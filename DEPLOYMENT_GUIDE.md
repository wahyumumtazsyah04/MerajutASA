# Deployment Guide
## MerajutASA Platform Deployment Overview

> **Mission-Critical Deployments**: Production-grade deployment procedures for a social impact platform protecting vulnerable children, implementing zero-downtime deployments with comprehensive safety measures.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide provides navigation to comprehensive deployment documentation for the MerajutASA Platform. As a child welfare platform serving vulnerable populations, all deployment procedures prioritize:

- **Child Safety First**: Zero compromise on data protection during deployments
- **Stakeholder Continuity**: Uninterrupted access for government, business, academic, and community partners
- **Compliance Maintenance**: Adherence to GDPR, Indonesian data protection laws, and child welfare regulations
- **Zero Downtime**: Children and caregivers always have access to critical services

### Child Protection Deployment Guarantees

```yaml
Safety Commitments:
  - Child data never exposed during deployments
  - Emergency access always available
  - Audit trails maintained throughout process
  - Compliance validation before going live
  - Child-facing features thoroughly tested
```

---

## 📋 Scope

This guide covers deployment navigation for:

**Included:**
- Links to detailed deployment procedures
- Environment-specific deployment paths
- Validation and monitoring references
- Security and compliance checkpoints
- Rollback and emergency procedures

**Excluded:**
- Detailed step-by-step procedures (see linked documentation)
- Sensitive configuration details (see secure documentation)
- Environment-specific secrets (managed securely)
- Vendor-specific implementation details
