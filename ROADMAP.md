# MerajutASA Platform Roadmap

## Purpose
Provide transparent visibility into platform development priorities that advance child welfare outcomes through systematic penta-helix stakeholder collaboration, architectural improvements, and impact measurement capabilities.

## Scope & Audience
- **Covered**: Near-term development milestones, architectural decisions, stakeholder-focused initiatives
- **Audience**: All penta-helix stakeholders requiring development visibility
- **Not Covered**: Detailed implementation specifications (see ADRs), operational metrics (see impact dashboards)

### Architectural Decisions (ADRs)
- [docs/architecture/decisions/README.md](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md) — Comprehensive architectural decision documentation with 30+ ADRs covering technology stack, security framework, and platform choices
- [docs/architecture/decisions/009-deployment-orchestration.md](docs/architecture/decisions/009-deployment-orchestration.md) — GitOps deployment strategy with ArgoCD implementation timeline and child safety considerations
- [docs/architecture/decisions/022-performance-monitoring-selection.md](docs/architecture/decisions/022-performance-monitoring-selection.md) — DataDog APM selection for comprehensive performance monitoring and stakeholder-specific dashboards

### Monitoring Dashboards
- [monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md](monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md) — Impact dashboard index enabling measurement of child welfare outcomes and stakeholder value creation
- [monitoring/dashboards/stakeholder/media/media-engagement-dashboard.md](monitoring/dashboards/stakeholder/media/media-engagement-dashboard.md) — Media engagement metrics and performance tracking dashboard

### Governance & Standards
- [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) — Penta-helix governance framework with decision-making processes and stakeholder collaboration structure
- [docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md) — Documentation standards ensuring child-safety-first, accessible content creation
- [docs/stakeholders/](docs/stakeholders/) — Stakeholder-specific documentation and engagement frameworks

## Milestones

### Short-term: Q1 2025 — Platform Infrastructure Foundation
**Goal**: Establish robust deployment and monitoring infrastructure supporting reliable child welfare service delivery
- **Deliverables**: 
  - **GitOps Deployment Implementation** (4-month timeline per [docs/architecture/decisions/009-deployment-orchestration.md](docs/architecture/decisions/009-deployment-orchestration.md))
    - Phase 1: ArgoCD foundation setup with RBAC and secret management (Month 1)
    - Phase 2: Multi-environment orchestration with blue-green deployment (Month 2)
    - Phase 3: Security integration and stakeholder workflows (Month 3)
    - Phase 4: Performance optimization and team training (Month 4)
  - **Performance Monitoring Deployment** (3-month timeline per [docs/architecture/decisions/022-performance-monitoring-selection.md](docs/architecture/decisions/022-performance-monitoring-selection.md))
    - Month 1: DataDog APM core setup with distributed tracing
    - Month 2: Advanced configuration with stakeholder-specific dashboards
    - Month 3: Optimization and comprehensive team training
- **Success Criteria**: 99.9% deployment success rate, zero-downtime deployments, 100% service monitoring coverage
- **Child Safety Impact**: Reliable infrastructure ensures continuous availability of child protection services with rapid emergency response capabilities

### Mid-term: Q2 2025 — Impact Measurement & Optimization
**Goal**: Operationalize comprehensive impact dashboards and performance-driven optimization for child welfare outcomes
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Impact Dashboard Integration** per [monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md](monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md)
    - Deploy stakeholder-specific performance dashboards with real-time metrics
    - Establish baseline metrics for child safety and penta-helix collaboration effectiveness
    - Implement automated reporting for government compliance and media transparency
  - **Performance-Driven Optimization**
    - 25% platform performance improvement through monitoring insights
    - Real-time emergency response system optimization (<1 second response time)
    - Child data access performance optimization (50% faster access during emergencies)
- **Success Criteria**: Real-time dashboard availability, >95% stakeholder adoption, 99.95% platform availability
- **Child Safety Impact**: Data-driven optimization of child protection services with measurable welfare outcome improvements

## Accessibility & Child Safety
All roadmap initiatives prioritize:
- **Child Protection**: Every milestone includes explicit child safety impact assessment
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all stakeholder-facing deliverables  
- **Privacy by Design**: Implementation follows security policies in [security/](security/) directory
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Development respects Indonesian context and community values

## Review Cadence

### Regular Assessment Schedule
- **Monthly Reviews**: Progress assessment against milestone success criteria with technical team leads and domain experts per [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)
- **Quarterly Stakeholder Reviews**: Comprehensive stakeholder feedback collection and roadmap adjustment with penta-helix representatives
- **Bi-annual Strategic Review**: Strategic alignment assessment with child welfare objectives and platform evolution planning

### Review Process Alignment
- **ADR Updates**: Roadmap milestone completion triggers related ADR status updates and implementation outcome documentation
- **Dashboard Integration**: Review process informed by real-time metrics from [monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md](monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md)
- **Governance Compliance**: All reviews follow governance framework in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) with child safety and stakeholder value assessment

### Decision Evolution Triggers
- Performance metrics indicating need for milestone adjustment or acceleration
- Stakeholder feedback requiring roadmap scope or timeline modification
- Child safety requirements necessitating priority changes or additional milestones
- Technology evolution opportunities for enhanced child welfare service delivery

## Validation & Monitoring
- **Monthly Reviews**: Progress assessment against defined success criteria
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Quarterly collection via established channels in [docs/stakeholders/](docs/stakeholders/)
- **Impact Measurement**: Continuous tracking via [monitoring/dashboards/impact/](monitoring/dashboards/impact/)
- **Course Correction**: Adaptive planning based on child welfare outcome data
