# MerajutASA Platform Roadmap

## Purpose
Provide transparent visibility into platform development priorities that advance child welfare outcomes through systematic penta-helix stakeholder collaboration, architectural improvements, and impact measurement capabilities.

## Scope & Audience
- **Covered**: Near-term development milestones, architectural decisions, stakeholder-focused initiatives
- **Audience**: All penta-helix stakeholders requiring development visibility
- **Not Covered**: Detailed implementation specifications (see ADRs), operational metrics (see impact dashboards)

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- [docs/architecture/decisions/README.md](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md) — Comprehensive architectural decision documentation with 30+ ADRs covering technology stack, security framework, and platform choices
- [monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md](monitoring/dashboards/impact/README.md) — Impact dashboard index enabling measurement of child welfare outcomes and stakeholder value
- [docs/stakeholders/media/README.md](docs/stakeholders/media/README.md) — Media stakeholder documentation referencing roadmap for reporting coordination
- [docs/instructions.md](docs/instructions.md) — Authoritative documentation standards ensuring grounded, child-safety-first content creation
- [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) — Governance framework establishing stakeholder collaboration structure

## Near-term Roadmap Items

### Q1 2025: Documentation Platform Maturity
**Goal**: Complete foundational documentation framework supporting all stakeholder needs

  - Finalize all core ADR documentation per [docs/architecture/decisions/README.md](docs/architecture/decisions/README.md)
  - Implement automated link checking and content validation
  - Complete stakeholder-specific documentation per [docs/stakeholders/](docs/stakeholders/)
- **Success Criteria**: ≥95% documentation coverage, <0.5% broken link rate
- **Child Safety Impact**: Enhanced transparency and accountability for child protection measures

### Q2 2025: Impact Measurement Integration  
**Goal**: Operationalize impact dashboards for real-time child welfare outcome tracking

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all stakeholder-facing deliverables  
- **Privacy by Design**: Implementation follows security policies in [security/](security/) directory
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Development respects Indonesian context and community values

## Validation & Monitoring
- **Monthly Reviews**: Progress assessment against defined success criteria
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Quarterly collection via established channels in [docs/stakeholders/](docs/stakeholders/)
