# Communication Security Policy

## Purpose
Reduce risk of data leaks and protect children by enforcing secure, documented communication when coordinating content.

## Scope & Audience
All maintainers and collaborators engaging in content planning, review, and publication.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- [docs/architecture/security/compliance-architecture.md] — Security-compliance architecture context.
- [docs/architecture/security/threat-model.md] — Threat scenarios to consider during coordination.
- [docs/architecture/security/data-protection.md] — Data protection controls.
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] — Behavior expectations; escalation paths.
- [SECURITY.md] — Security disclosure process (for vulnerabilities).

## How-To / Steps
1) Use organization-approved private channels for draft exchanges; avoid public sharing before approval.
2) Do not transmit PII of children; redact and anonymize.
3) Share links to internal docs instead of copying sensitive text.
4) Record decisions in PRs/issues for auditability.

## Accessibility & Child Safety
- Provide accessible formats for materials; never compromise child safety for convenience.

## Validation & Monitoring
- Periodic security review aligns with threat model; incidents handled per SECURITY.md.

## Changelog
- 1.0.0 (2025-08-08): Initial policy.
