## Purpose
Define authentication, authorization, and privilege management controls to protect MerajutASA platform resources and ensure appropriate access to child welfare data based on role requirements and security principles.

## Scope & Audience
- **Primary**: System administrators, security teams, developers implementing access controls
- **Secondary**: All platform users requiring authenticated access
- **Coverage**: All platform authentication mechanisms, authorization systems, and privilege management processes
- **Exclusions**: Public website access (covered by platform-level controls)

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Overall security framework: [security/policies/security-policy.md](./security-policy.md)
- Acceptable use requirements: [security/policies/acceptable-use.md](./acceptable-use.md)
- Communication security practices: [security/policies/communication-security.md](./communication-security.md)
- Data sensitivity classifications: [security/policies/data-classification.md](./data-classification.md)
- Security incident procedures: [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
- Compliance requirements: [COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md](../../COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md)
- Architecture security details: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Controls

### Authentication Framework
**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirements**:
- Mandatory MFA for all platform accounts with access to child data
- SMS, email, and authenticator app options available
- Hardware tokens required for administrative and high-privilege accounts
- Biometric authentication support for compatible devices and high-security scenarios

**Account Security Standards**:
- Password complexity requirements: minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Password rotation policy: required every 90 days for privileged accounts
- Account lockout after 5 failed authentication attempts
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity for child data access
- Secure password recovery procedures with identity verification

### Authorization Model
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation**:
- Principle of least privilege enforced across all system access
- Role definitions aligned with stakeholder categories and job functions
- Regular access reviews conducted quarterly with approval workflows
- Automated deprovisioning when employment or volunteer status changes
- Separation of duties for sensitive child welfare operations

**Child Data Access Controls**:
- Restricted access requiring documented authorization per [security/policies/data-classification.md](./data-classification.md)
- Mandatory training completion before child data access granted
- Additional approval required for bulk child data operations
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for unusual child data access patterns
- Audit trails maintained for all child data interactions

### Privilege Management
**Administrative Account Controls**:
- Separate administrative accounts required for privileged operations
- Administrative sessions limited to necessary duration (maximum 4 hours)
- Privileged account activities logged and monitored continuously
- Emergency access procedures with after-action reporting requirements
- Regular privilege escalation reviews and justification documentation

**Service Account Security**:
- Service accounts use certificate-based authentication where possible
- Automated credential rotation for service account passwords/keys
- Service account permissions restricted to specific functions and resources
- Service account activity monitoring and anomaly detection
- Documentation required for all service account purposes and access levels

### Zero Trust Architecture
**Continuous Verification**:
- Every access request verified regardless of location or previous authentication
- Device compliance checking before platform access granted
- Network micro-segmentation preventing lateral movement
- Encrypted communications required for all platform interactions
- Real-time risk assessment for access decisions

**Identity and Device Management**:
- Device registration and compliance verification required
- Mobile device management (MDM) for platform access from mobile devices
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) software required on work devices
- Regular device security updates and patch management
- Remote device wipe capability for lost or stolen devices

### Access Monitoring and Auditing
**Real-Time Access Monitoring**:
- 24/7 monitoring of authentication events and access patterns
- Automated alerting for suspicious access attempts or behavior
- Geographic access controls with exceptions requiring approval
- Rate limiting and throttling to prevent automated attacks
- Integration with Security Operations Center (SOC) for incident response

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
- Complete logging of all authentication and authorization events
- Access logs retained for 7 years per regulatory requirements
- Tamper-evident log storage with integrity verification
- Regular log analysis for security incidents and policy violations
- Quarterly access review reports for compliance validation

### Guest and External Access
**Partner and Stakeholder Access**:
- Separate authentication realm for external stakeholders
- Limited access permissions based on partnership agreements
- Mandatory security training before external access granted
- Regular review of external access permissions and justification
- Secure guest network isolation from internal platform resources

**Temporary Access Management**:
- Time-limited access grants with automatic expiration
- Approval workflow required for temporary access requests
- Enhanced monitoring during temporary access periods
- Mandatory access revocation confirmation upon completion
- Documentation of temporary access purpose and duration

## Accessibility & Child Safety
- Access control interfaces designed for users with disabilities
- Screen reader compatibility for authentication processes
- Alternative authentication methods for users unable to use standard procedures
- Child-safe authentication mechanisms where children interact with platform
- Trauma-informed access procedures for child welfare emergency situations
- Multilingual support for authentication interfaces in Indonesian and local languages

## Validation & Monitoring
**Access Control Effectiveness Metrics**:
- Authentication success/failure rates and patterns analysis
- Unauthorized access attempt detection and response times
- MFA adoption rates across all user categories
- Privileged account usage patterns and compliance verification
- Child data access compliance with authorization requirements

**Continuous Improvement Process**:
- Monthly access control security review meetings
- Quarterly privilege escalation and access review cycles
- Annual comprehensive access control assessment
- Integration of access control lessons learned from security incidents
- Regular updates based on evolving threat landscape and compliance requirements

## Changelog
- 2025-01-27: Initial access control policy created with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and privilege management controls aligned with security policy framework
