## Purpose
Establish a comprehensive security policy framework that protects child welfare data, ensures platform security, and maintains compliance across all stakeholder interactions in the MerajutASA penta-helix ecosystem.

## Scope & Audience
- **Primary**: All platform users, developers, administrators, security teams, staff, volunteers, and partners
- **Secondary**: Government agencies, business partners, academic researchers, community organizations, media representatives
- **Coverage**: All MerajutASA platform components, data, systems, and stakeholder interactions

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Security disclosure and incident response: [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
- Acceptable use guidelines: [security/policies/acceptable-use.md](./acceptable-use.md)
- Communication security requirements: [security/policies/communication-security.md](./communication-security.md)
- Data classification and handling: [security/policies/data-classification.md](./data-classification.md)
- Access control implementation: [security/policies/access-control.md](./access-control.md)
- Compliance framework overview: [COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md](../../COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md)
- Security architecture details: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Controls

### Child Data Protection Framework
**Priority**: Critical - All child-related data receives highest protection level
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all child information
- Access logging and monitoring per [security/policies/access-control.md](./access-control.md)
- Data minimization principles - collect only necessary child information
- Automatic retention policies with secure deletion procedures
- Trauma-informed security practices for child interactions

### Security Policy Hierarchy
**Core Policies** (This Document + Specialized Policies):
1. **Security Policy** (This Document) - Master framework and governance
2. **Access Control Policy** - Authentication, authorization, and privilege management
3. **Acceptable Use Policy** - Platform usage guidelines and restrictions
4. **Communication Security Policy** - Secure coordination and information sharing
5. **Data Classification Policy** - Information sensitivity levels and handling

### Risk Management Framework
**Threat Assessment**:
- Child safety threats receive immediate escalation per [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
- Platform security vulnerabilities tracked and remediated systematically
- Stakeholder trust and reputation risks evaluated for all changes
- Compliance violations prevent platform operations until resolved

**Control Implementation**:
- Multi-layered defense strategy with redundant protections
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Continuous monitoring and automated threat detection
- Incident response procedures with defined escalation paths

### Compliance Integration
**Regulatory Adherence**:
- GDPR compliance for all European stakeholder interactions
- Indonesian data protection law compliance for domestic operations
- Child Online Protection Standards implementation
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing security

**Audit and Reporting**:
- Quarterly security control effectiveness reviews
- Annual third-party security assessments
- Continuous compliance monitoring and reporting
- Stakeholder transparency through appropriate channels

### Security Operations
**24/7 Security Monitoring**:
- Real-time threat detection and response capabilities
- Automated security event correlation and analysis
- Security Operations Center (SOC) with trained analysts
- Integration with law enforcement for child safety emergencies

**Change Management**:
- Security review required for all platform changes
- Risk assessment for new features and integrations
- Secure development lifecycle implementation
- Emergency change procedures for critical security issues

## Accessibility & Child Safety
- Security controls designed to protect child welfare without impeding legitimate access
- Accessible security training and documentation in Indonesian and local languages
- Child-friendly security interfaces where children interact with platform
- Trauma-informed security incident response for child-related situations
- Support for users with disabilities in security procedures

## Validation & Monitoring
**Policy Effectiveness Metrics**:
- Zero tolerance for child data breaches - immediate escalation and remediation
- Security incident response time targets per [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
- Compliance audit results and corrective action completion
- Stakeholder security satisfaction and trust measurement

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Monthly security policy review meetings with stakeholder feedback
- Quarterly policy updates based on threat landscape changes
- Annual comprehensive security program assessment
- Integration of security lessons learned into policy updates
