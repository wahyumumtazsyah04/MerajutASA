## Purpose
Establish the core security policy for MerajutASA. Protect children and stakeholders by defining mandatory controls, links to detailed policies, and verification paths.

## Scope & Audience
- Applies to all platform components, data, users, and environments.
- For security, maintainers, administrators, and reviewers across the penta-helix.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Root security overview: [SECURITY.md]
- Data sensitivity levels: [security/policies/data-classification.md]
- Communication channels & escalation: [security/policies/communication-security.md]
- Acceptable use requirements: [security/policies/acceptable-use.md]
- Control catalog (architecture): [docs/architecture/compliance/security-controls.md]
- Compliance overview: [COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md]

## Policy Statements
1. Child Safety First: Security decisions prioritize protection of children over convenience or speed.
2. Least Privilege: Access is restricted to the minimum necessary (see Access Control policy below).
3. Defense in Depth: Multiple complementary controls protect data and services.
4. Secure-by-Default: New features must enable secure defaults and document risks.
5. Incident Readiness: Detected issues are triaged and escalated per SECURITY.md with auditability.
6. Grounded Documentation: All security guidance must cite internal sources and avoid unverifiable claims.

## Controls (See Also “Security Controls” in Architecture)
- Identity and Access: MFA for privileged roles; RBAC enforced; periodic access reviews.
- Data Protection: Encryption in transit and at rest for sensitive data; classification-driven handling.
- Change Management: Small, reversible changes; peer review; automated checks.
- Monitoring: Security-relevant logs retained and reviewed; alerts linked to on-call.
- Vendor/Integration: Contracts require minimum controls; credentials handled securely; secrets not committed.

## Accessibility & Child Safety
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA for user-facing security UX.
- Never include PII of children in examples or test data; use anonymized data.
- Provide accessible reporting channels for security and child-safety concerns.

## Validation & Monitoring (optional)
- Link checks and policy linting in CI.
- Periodic reviews against [COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md].
- Dashboard references provided in relevant monitoring docs (outside this file’s scope).

## Changelog
- 1.0.0 (2025-08-08): Initial core policy, grounded to existing internal documents.
