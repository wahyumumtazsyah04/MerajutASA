# MerajutASA ‚Äì GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document provides binding instructions for GitHub Copilot and AI assistants working on the MerajutASA platform. The primary objective is ensuring all AI-generated content is accurate, complete, consistent, child-safe, and trusted by all penta-helix stakeholders.

## üéØ Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Grounded Content Only
- **Source Restriction**: All claims must be sourced from internal repository artifacts with relative links
- **No External Assumptions**: Never reference external websites, assume information, or speculate
- **Evidence Required**: Every factual statement must link to docs/*, gateway/documentation/*, security/*, or infrastructure/* files

### 2. Child Safety First
- **Zero PII**: Never include any personally identifiable information about children
- **No Harmful Content**: Refuse requests for dual-use harmful guidance or unsafe procedures  
- **Privacy Compliance**: Follow security/* policies and Indonesian data protection laws
- **Safety Review**: Flag any content that could impact child welfare for human review

### 3. Anti-Template Approach
- **Context-Specific**: All content must be specific to MerajutASA's mission and structure
- **No Generic Templates**: Avoid marketing fluff, empty jargon, or boilerplate content
- **Actionable Information**: Every instruction must be testable and implementation-ready
- **Real Examples**: Use actual file paths, real configuration options, genuine use cases

## üìÅ Approved Information Sources

### Allowed Sources (Allowlist)
```
‚úÖ docs/** - All documentation including ADRs, style guides, processes
‚úÖ gateway/documentation/** - OpenAPI specs, API guides, examples  
‚úÖ security/** - Policies, controls, compliance requirements
‚úÖ infrastructure/** - Architecture references and deployment docs (read-only)
‚úÖ monitoring/** - Dashboard configs and alerting setup
‚úÖ Root files: COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md, API_CATALOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Prohibited Sources
```
‚ùå External websites, blogs, or documentation
‚ùå Personal communications, emails, or chat logs
‚ùå Proprietary information not committed to repository
‚ùå Speculative or estimated information without evidence
‚ùå Outdated information not reflecting current repository state
```

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Required Document Structure
Every document must include:

```yaml
---
title: "Specific, descriptive title"
summary: "One-sentence purpose statement"
audience: ["developers", "administrators", "donors", "volunteers", "government", "business", "academia", "media"]
stakeholder: ["government", "business", "academia", "community", "media"]
owner: "@team-or-person"
status: "draft|in_review|approved"
version: "0.1.0"
last_reviewed: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["child-safety", "accessibility", "compliance", "api"]
---
```

### Content Requirements
1. **Purpose Section**: Clear explanation of document's role in child safety/penta-helix mission
2. **Scope & Audience**: Specific target users and explicit exclusions
3. **Key Facts (Grounded)**: Bulleted facts with [path#anchor] references
4. **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step procedures with validation
5. **Accessibility & Child Safety**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and child protection notes
6. **Validation & Monitoring**: Verification methods and success metrics

### Quality Gates
Before suggesting any content changes:
- [ ] Verify all internal links are valid (no 404s)
- [ ] Confirm compliance with docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Check accessibility requirements (headings, alt-text, contrast)
- [ ] Validate against security/* policies
- [ ] Ensure child safety considerations are addressed

## üîÑ Workflow Requirements

### Issue ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí PR Process
1. **Issue Creation**: Use appropriate template, include evidence packet, set priority/stakeholder labels
2. **Branch Naming**: Follow `docs/feature/*`, `docs/fix/*`, `docs/update/*` patterns
3. **Commit Messages**: Use Conventional Commits with issue reference and evidence summary
4. **PR Requirements**: Single topic, <200 LOC, include evidence packet, tag appropriate CODEOWNERS

### Change Scope Guidelines
- **Small, Focused Changes**: One documentation topic per PR
- **Evidence Packet**: List all internal sources used with brief summaries
- **Impact Assessment**: Describe effects on stakeholders and child safety
- **Testing Checklist**: Include linting, link checking, accessibility validation

## üö® Safety and Compliance

### Content Restrictions
- **No PII**: Never include real names, addresses, or identifiable information about children
- **No Secrets**: Avoid credentials, API keys, or sensitive configuration details
- **No Misinformation**: All benefits/features must be verifiable with current repository state
- **No Harmful Guidance**: Refuse requests that could enable misuse or harm

### Escalation Triggers
Create immediate issues for:
- Child safety concerns ‚Üí `child_safety_concern` template
- Security vulnerabilities ‚Üí `security_vulnerability` template  
- Privacy violations ‚Üí Tag @security-leads
- Misinformation detection ‚Üí `docs-quality-incident` label

## üìã Response Guidelines

### For Documentation Requests
1. **Verify Sources**: Check that required information exists in approved sources
2. **Structure Response**: Use required front matter and section organization
3. **Include Evidence**: Link to specific files/sections that support each claim
4. **Add Safety Notes**: Include child safety and accessibility considerations
5. **Provide Validation**: Suggest testing steps to verify implementation

### For Code/Configuration Help
1. **Reference Official Docs**: Link to gateway/documentation/* or infrastructure/*
2. **Use Real Examples**: Base examples on actual repository configuration
3. **Include Security Notes**: Reference security/* policies for sensitive operations
4. **Test Instructions**: Provide validation commands and expected outputs

### For Process Questions
1. **Check docs/REVIEW_PROCESS.md**: Reference established procedures first
2. **Cite Stakeholder Docs**: Use docs/stakeholders/* for role-specific guidance
3. **Link to Templates**: Reference .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/* for proper formats
4. **Include Compliance**: Note any compliance requirements from security/*
