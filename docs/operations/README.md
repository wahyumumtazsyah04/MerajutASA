## MerajutASA Platform Operations & Site Reliability Engineering

Welcome to the MerajutASA Platform operations documentation. This comprehensive guide implements Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles following Google's SRE framework, adapted specifically for social impact platforms handling sensitive child welfare data.

## 🎯 Operations Philosophy

### Social Impact Operations Model
Our operations approach follows the "Metrics That Matter" framework from the Stanford Social Innovation Review, ensuring technical performance directly maps to social impact outcomes.

#### Core Principles

##### 1. Child Safety First Reliability
- **Zero-Downtime for Safety**: Child safety features must maintain 99.99% availability
- **Safety-Critical Alerting**: Immediate escalation for any safety-related system issues
- **Redundant Safety Systems**: Multiple failsafes for child protection mechanisms
- **Privacy-Preserving Monitoring**: Observe system health without accessing child data

##### 2. Mission-Critical Service Levels
```yaml
Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
  Child Safety Services:
    Availability: 99.99% (4.32 minutes downtime/month)
    Response Time: <100ms for safety checks
    Error Rate: <0.01% for protection mechanisms
    
  Core Platform Services:
    Availability: 99.9% (43.2 minutes downtime/month)
    Response Time: <500ms for user interactions
    Error Rate: <0.1% for critical operations
    
  Integration Services:
    Availability: 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime/month)
    Response Time: <2s for external API calls
    Error Rate: <1% for non-critical integrations
    
  Reporting & Analytics:
    Availability: 99.0% (7.2 hours downtime/month)
    Response Time: <10s for dashboard queries
    Error Rate: <5% for non-real-time analytics
```

##### 3. Stakeholder-Centric Operations
- **Government**: Compliance reporting and regulatory transparency
- **Business**: Partnership integration and impact measurement
- **Academia**: Research data access and methodology transparency
- **Community**: Volunteer engagement and donation processing
- **Media**: Story access and impact visualization

##### 4. Cost-Effective Social Impact
Following the AWS Well-Architected Framework for social impact organizations, optimizing operational efficiency to maximize donation impact.
