# Architecture Diagrams and Models
## Visual Documentation for MerajutASA Platform Architecture

> **Mission**: Provide comprehensive visual documentation that enables all stakeholders to understand the MerajutASA platform architecture through clear, accessible, and professionally maintained diagrams that prioritize child safety, stakeholder collaboration, and technical excellence.

---

## 🎯 Diagram Philosophy

### Child-Centered Visual Communication
All architectural diagrams must prioritize child safety and welfare understanding:

```yaml
Diagram Principles:
  Child Safety Focus: Visual representation of protection mechanisms
  Stakeholder Clarity: Clear communication for diverse audiences
  
Visual Values:
  Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant visual elements
  Consistency: Unified visual language across all diagrams
```

### Penta-Helix Visual Architecture
