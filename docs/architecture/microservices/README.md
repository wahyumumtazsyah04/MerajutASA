  Domain-Driven Design: Business domain alignment with service boundaries
  Single Responsibility: Each service owns one business domain
  Data Autonomy: Services own their data with clear boundaries
  Failure Isolation: Service failures don't cascade across the system

    Business Services: Partnership management and CSR coordination
    Academic Services: Research, education, and knowledge management
    Community Services: Volunteer coordination and engagement
    Media Services: Content management and public awareness
```
