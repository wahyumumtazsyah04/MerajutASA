# Event Sourcing Documentation
## MerajutASA Platform - Event-Driven Architecture

> **Event Sourcing Mission**: "Implementing comprehensive event sourcing architecture that captures every significant action in our child welfare ecosystem, ensuring complete auditability, transparency, and accountability while enabling powerful analytics and compliance reporting for the protection and betterment of children's lives."

---

## üåä Event Sourcing Philosophy

### Child-Centered Event Design
Every event in our system serves to protect, track, and improve outcomes for children:

```yaml
Event Sourcing Principles:
  Complete Auditability: Every action affecting child welfare is permanently recorded
  Transparency: Stakeholders can trace all decisions and their rationale
  Accountability: Clear attribution of all actions to responsible parties
  Privacy Protection: Child identity protection while maintaining operational transparency
  Immutable History: Permanent record that cannot be altered or deleted
  
Event Standards:
  Child Safety Priority: Safety-related events get highest priority processing
  Real-time Processing: Critical events processed immediately
  Compliance Ready: Events structured for regulatory reporting
  Analytics Enabled: Events designed for impact measurement and research
  Cross-Stakeholder: Events support multi-stakeholder collaboration workflows
```

### Academic Research Foundation
Event sourcing implementation based on distributed systems and data engineering research:

```yaml
