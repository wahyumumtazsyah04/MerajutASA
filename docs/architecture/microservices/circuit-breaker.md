## 🛡️ Circuit Breaker Philosophy

### Child-Safety-First Resilience Design
Every circuit breaker pattern prioritizes continuity of child protection services and stakeholder coordination:

```yaml
Resilience Principles:
  Child Safety Continuity: Critical child services always remain available
  Graceful Degradation: Non-critical features fail gracefully while maintaining core functionality
  Rapid Recovery: Fast detection and recovery from service failures
  Stakeholder Notification: Transparent failure communication across stakeholder groups
  Proactive Protection: Prevent cascade failures before they impact child safety
  
Resilience Standards:
  Failure Detection: Sub-second failure detection for critical services
  Circuit Response: Immediate circuit opening for repeated failures
  Degraded Mode: Graceful degradation with reduced functionality
  Recovery Testing: Automated recovery validation and health verification
  Impact Isolation: Prevent service failures from affecting dependent systems
```
