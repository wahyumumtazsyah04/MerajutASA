## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture Philosophy

### Child-Centered Security Design
Security architecture prioritizing child protection and data sovereignty:

```yaml
Security Principles:
  Child Safety First: Every security control protects vulnerable children
  Privacy by Design: Data protection built into architecture foundation
  Zero Trust: Never trust, always verify access requests
  
Defense Strategy:
  Layered Protection: Multiple security controls at every level
  Proactive Defense: Threat hunting and prevention over reaction
  Stakeholder Trust: Security transparency for community confidence
```

### Penta-Helix Security Model
