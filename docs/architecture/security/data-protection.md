## üéØ Data Protection Philosophy

### Child-Centered Privacy Framework
All data protection measures prioritize the rights and safety of vulnerable children:

```yaml
Core Protection Principles:
  Privacy by Design: Default privacy settings for all child data
  Data Minimization: Collect only essential information for child welfare
  Purpose Limitation: Use data exclusively for child protection and welfare
  Age-Appropriate Controls: Special protections for children under 18

Child Welfare Integration:
  Best Interests Standard: UN Convention on Rights of the Child Article 3
  Evolving Capacities: Age-appropriate consent and participation
  Protection Priority: Safety takes precedence over convenience
  Cultural Sensitivity: Indonesian cultural values in privacy decisions
```

### Penta-Helix Data Governance Model
Collaborative data protection supporting multi-stakeholder engagement:
