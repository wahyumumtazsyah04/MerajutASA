# Authorization Model and Access Control
## Comprehensive Permission Management for Child Protection Platform

> **Mission**: Design and implement a sophisticated, secure, and scalable authorization framework that ensures fine-grained access control for all penta-helix stakeholders while maintaining the highest standards of child protection through role-based, attribute-based, and risk-adaptive authorization mechanisms.

---

## 🎯 Authorization Architecture Philosophy

### Child-Centered Access Control
Authorization design prioritizing child safety through comprehensive permission management:

```yaml
Authorization Principles:
  Child Safety First: Every permission decision protects vulnerable children
  Least Privilege: Minimum required access for legitimate purposes
  Contextual Access: Permissions based on role, risk, and purpose
  
Access Control Framework:
  Stakeholder-Aware: Different permission models for each stakeholder type
  Dynamic Authorization: Real-time permission evaluation and adaptation
  Audit-Centric: Complete traceability of all access decisions
```

### Penta-Helix Authorization Model

  Cross-Border Data Policy:
    Rule: "PERMIT data access IF resource.location = subject.location 
           OR (resource.cross_border_approved = true 
           AND subject.international_clearance = true
