## 🎯 Network Security Philosophy

### Child-Centered Network Protection
Network security architecture prioritizing child safety and data sovereignty:

```yaml
Network Security Principles:
  Zero Trust Network: Never trust, always verify network access
  Child Data Protection: Enhanced security for vulnerable population data
  Microsegmentation: Isolate child data from general platform traffic
  
Network Defense Strategy:
  Layered Protection: Multiple security controls at every network layer
  Stakeholder Access: Secure communication channels for all collaborators
  Real-time Monitoring: Continuous network threat detection and response
  Cultural Sensitivity: Network design respecting Indonesian infrastructure
```
