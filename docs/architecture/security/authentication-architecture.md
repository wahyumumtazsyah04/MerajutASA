## üéØ Authentication Architecture Philosophy

### Child-Centered Identity Protection
Authentication design prioritizing child safety and privacy across all access scenarios:

```yaml
Authentication Principles:
  Child Safety First: Every authentication decision protects vulnerable children
  Privacy by Design: Minimal data collection with maximum protection
  Zero Trust: Continuous verification of all identity claims
  
Identity Protection Framework:
  Stakeholder-Aware: Different security requirements for each stakeholder type
  Risk-Adaptive: Authentication strength based on risk assessment
  Child-Specific: Enhanced protection for child-related data access
```

### Penta-Helix Authentication Model
