# Service Mesh Security Policies
## Comprehensive Security Framework for Microservices Communication

> **Mission**: Implement comprehensive service mesh security policies that ensure encrypted inter-service communication, identity-based authentication, and fine-grained authorization while maintaining child data protection throughout all microservices interactions.

## üéØ Service Mesh Security Framework

### Child Data Protection in Service Communication
All service-to-service communication containing child data must adhere to strict security policies:

```yaml
Core Security Principles:
  Zero Trust: No implicit trust between services
  mTLS Enforcement: All communications encrypted by default
  Identity Verification: Service-based authentication required
  Access Control: Policy-based authorization for child data
  
Child Welfare Protection:
  Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption for all child data flows
  Audit Logging: Complete traceability of service interactions
  Policy Enforcement: Automatic blocking of unauthorized access
  Emergency Override: Secure emergency access procedures
```

### Penta-Helix Service Security Model
Service mesh policies designed to support multi-stakeholder access patterns:

- **üèõÔ∏è Government Services**: Secure inter-agency data exchange
- **üè¢ Business Services**: Protected partnership API communications  
- **üéì Academic Services**: Anonymized research data access
- **üë• Community Services**: Volunteer platform security
- **üì∞ Media Services**: Content management protection

## üîí Policy Implementation

### mTLS Configuration
```yaml
# Service Mesh mTLS Policy
enforceStrictMTLS: true
certificateRotation: "24h"
cipherSuites:
  - "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
  - "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
```

### Child Data Service Policies
```yaml
# Child Data Protection Rules
childDataServices:
  allowedCommunication:
    - authentication-service
    - audit-logging-service
    - emergency-response-service
  deniedByDefault: true
  auditLevel: "STRICT"
```

### Emergency Response Policies
```yaml
# Emergency Access Override
emergencyPolicies:
  childSafetyIncident:
    overrideLevel: "CRITICAL"
    approvedServices: ["emergency-coordinator", "child-safety-alert"]
    auditRequired: true
    timeLimit: "30m"
```

## üìã Policy Enforcement

### Access Control Matrix
| Service Type | Child Data Access | Authentication | Authorization | Audit Level |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Authentication | Read Only | Service Certificate | Identity Policy | HIGH |
| Child Welfare | Read/Write | mTLS + Identity | RBAC + Policy | CRITICAL |
| Analytics | Anonymized Only | Service Certificate | Research Policy | MEDIUM |
| Emergency | Override Access | Emergency Certificate | Emergency Policy | CRITICAL |

### Monitoring and Compliance
- **Real-time Policy Violation Detection**: Automatic blocking and alerting
- **Service Communication Audit**: Complete logging of all interactions
- **Policy Compliance Reporting**: Regular assessment and validation
- **Emergency Response Testing**: Quarterly emergency access validation
