Threat modeling prioritizing unique vulnerabilities of children and child welfare systems:

```yaml
Threat Modeling Principles:
  Child Safety First: Threats to children receive highest priority
  Vulnerability-Focused: Address child-specific attack vectors
  Stakeholder-Aware: Consider penta-helix threat landscape
  
Risk Assessment Framework:
  Impact-Driven: Measure risk by potential child harm
  Prevention-Focused: Proactive threat mitigation strategies
  Continuous Evolution: Adaptive threat model updates
```
