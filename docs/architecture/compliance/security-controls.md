## 🛡️ Security Control Framework

### Defense-in-Depth Architecture
```yaml
Security Philosophy:
  Child Safety First: Every control protects vulnerable children
  Zero Trust Model: Never trust, always verify
  
Security Principles:
  Least Privilege: Minimum necessary access only
  Defense in Depth: Multiple overlapping security layers
  Fail Secure: System fails to secure state
  Security by Design: Built-in from architecture inception
```
