## üìä Data Architecture Philosophy

### Child-Centered Data Design
Every data decision prioritizes child privacy, safety, and long-term welfare:

```yaml
Data Principles:
  Child Privacy First: Minimal data collection with maximum protection
  Consent by Design: Age-appropriate consent and guardian approval
  Data Minimization: Collect only necessary data for child welfare
  Purpose Limitation: Data used only for stated child welfare purposes
  Retention Limits: Automatic deletion based on child's best interest
  
Data Classification Framework:
  Highly Sensitive: Child personal identification and medical data
  Sensitive: Case management and family information
  Internal: Operational data and system metrics
  Public: Anonymized statistics and success stories
  Research: De-identified data for academic collaboration
```

### Academic Research-Backed Data Strategy
Data architecture based on established frameworks and research:

```yaml
