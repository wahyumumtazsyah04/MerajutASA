# Storage Strategy and Architecture
## Comprehensive Data Storage Design for Child Welfare Platform

> **Mission**: Design and implement a robust, secure, and scalable storage architecture that prioritizes child data protection, ensures high availability, and supports multi-stakeholder data requirements while maintaining compliance with Indonesian data sovereignty and international child safety standards.

---

## üéØ Storage Architecture Overview

### Child-Centered Storage Design
Our storage strategy prioritizes child safety and data protection across all layers:

```yaml
Storage Principles:
  Child Safety First: All storage decisions prioritize child data protection
  Data Sovereignty: Indonesian data remains within national boundaries
  Zero-Trust Storage: Encrypt everything, verify all access
  
Stakeholder Integration:
  Government: Compliance and audit-ready storage
  Business: Performance and reliability metrics
  Academia: Research data anonymization and access
  Community: Volunteer data protection
  Media: Asset management and content delivery
```
