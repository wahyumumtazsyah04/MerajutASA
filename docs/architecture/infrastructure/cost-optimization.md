## 💰 Cost Optimization Philosophy

### Child-Centered Financial Stewardship
Cost optimization prioritizing maximum impact for children and communities:

```yaml
Financial Principles:
  Impact First: Every dollar spent must serve child welfare
  Transparency: Clear cost allocation to all stakeholders
  Sustainability: Long-term platform viability
  
Value Optimization:
  Cost Efficiency: Maximum impact per rupiah invested
  Resource Allocation: Priority-based spending decisions
  Stakeholder Value: ROI measurement for all participants
```
