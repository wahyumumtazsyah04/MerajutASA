## üéØ Disaster Recovery Philosophy

### Child-Centered Resilience Strategy
Our disaster recovery approach prioritizes child safety and service continuity:

```yaml
DR Principles:
  Child Safety First: Continuous protection even during disasters
  Zero Data Loss: Complete preservation of child welfare data
  Rapid Recovery: Minimal service interruption for critical functions
  
Stakeholder Continuity:
  Government: Uninterrupted compliance and reporting
  Business: Maintained partnership and donation processing
  Academia: Protected research data and ongoing studies
  Community: Sustained volunteer coordination and support
  Media: Continuous communication and awareness campaigns
```
