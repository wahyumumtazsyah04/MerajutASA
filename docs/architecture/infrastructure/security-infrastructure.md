# Security Infrastructure Architecture
## Defense-in-Depth Strategy for Child Protection Platform

> **Mission**: Implement comprehensive, multi-layered security infrastructure that protects vulnerable children's data while enabling secure collaboration among penta-helix stakeholders through zero-trust architecture, advanced threat detection, and privacy-by-design principles.

---

## 🛡️ Security Infrastructure Philosophy

### Child-Centered Security Design
Security infrastructure prioritizing child protection and data sovereignty:

```yaml
Security Principles:
  Child Safety First: Every security control protects vulnerable children
  Privacy by Design: Data protection built into infrastructure foundation
  Zero Trust: Never trust, always verify access requests
  
Defense Strategy:
  Layered Protection: Multiple security controls at every level
  Proactive Defense: Threat hunting and prevention over reaction
  Stakeholder Trust: Security transparency for community confidence
```

### Penta-Helix Security Model
