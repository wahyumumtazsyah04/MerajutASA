## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a sophisticated data persistence strategy that can handle diverse data types across the penta-helix collaboration model while maintaining the highest standards of child data protection. The platform must support:

- **Highly sensitive child personal information** requiring maximum security and compliance with Indonesian data protection laws, GDPR, and COPPA
- **Operational orphanage data** with different retention and access patterns
- **Government compliance and reporting data** with audit trail requirements
- **Business partnership and financial data** with transaction integrity needs
- **Academic research datasets** requiring anonymization and long-term retention
- **Community engagement data** with high read/write ratios and geographic distribution
- **Media content and assets** with version control and global distribution requirements

The database strategy must support the microservices architecture (ADR-001) while providing data consistency, security isolation, and performance optimization across all stakeholder workflows.

### Child Welfare Considerations
This database strategy directly impacts our ability to protect vulnerable children through:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensuring all child personal data remains within Indonesian jurisdiction with controlled cross-border access
- **Privacy by Design**: Implementing database-level privacy controls including encryption, anonymization, and access auditing
- **Emergency Data Access**: Providing rapid access to critical child information during emergency situations while maintaining security controls
- **Data Minimization**: Storing only necessary child information with automatic purging of outdated or unnecessary data
- **Audit Compliance**: Maintaining complete audit trails for all child data access, modification, and sharing activities

- ‚ùå **Development Overhead**: Teams need expertise in multiple database technologies and query languages
- ‚ùå **Backup Complexity**: Coordinated backup and recovery across different database systems
- ‚ùå **Monitoring Complexity**: Multiple monitoring systems and alerting for different database technologies

**Child Safety Assessment**: **Excellent** - Enables database-level security controls optimized for child data protection. Row-level security in PostgreSQL provides granular access control for child records. Specialized audit databases ensure tamper-proof compliance reporting.

**Stakeholder Value**:
- **Government**: PostgreSQL with audit extensions provides comprehensive compliance reporting and inter-agency data sharing
- **Business**: Redis caching enables real-time transaction processing while MongoDB supports flexible partnership data models
- **Academic**: ClickHouse enables complex analytical queries on large anonymized datasets with statistical computing integration
- **Community**: MongoDB's geographic indexing supports location-based volunteer matching with mobile optimization
- **Media**: Document databases support flexible content models with version control and collaborative editing workflows

**Implementation Assessment**:
- **Complexity**: High - Requires expertise in multiple database technologies and sophisticated data pipeline management
- **Timeline**: 12 months with phased rollout starting with PostgreSQL for core child data
- **Cost**: High operational cost ($400K annually) but optimized performance reduces compute requirements
- **Risk**: Medium - Well-established technologies with extensive community support and operational tools

### Option 2: PostgreSQL-Centric Architecture with Extensions
**Description**: Use PostgreSQL as the primary database with specialized extensions and configurations for different use cases. JSONB for document storage, PostGIS for geographic data, PostgreSQL-native analytics, TimescaleDB for time-series data, and FDW (Foreign Data Wrappers) for external system integration.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Operational Simplicity**: Single database technology reduces operational complexity and required expertise
- ‚úÖ **ACID Transactions**: Strong consistency guarantees across all data operations with PostgreSQL's robust transaction support
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Security**: Row-level security, column encryption, and comprehensive audit logging built into PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Extension Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of extensions for specialized requirements without additional database systems
- ‚úÖ **Backup Simplicity**: Unified backup and recovery procedures across all platform data

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Performance Limitations**: Single database system may not optimize for all workload types and access patterns
- ‚ùå **Scaling Bottlenecks**: All operations limited by PostgreSQL's scaling characteristics and performance envelope
- ‚ùå **Technology Lock-in**: Difficult to adopt specialized technologies as requirements evolve beyond PostgreSQL capabilities
- ‚ùå **Resource Contention**: Analytical queries compete with transactional operations for database resources
- ‚ùå **Extension Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on PostgreSQL extensions creates upgrade and compatibility challenges

**Child Safety Assessment**: **Good** - PostgreSQL's row-level security and audit logging provide strong child data protection. However, lacks specialized security features available in dedicated security-focused database systems.

**Implementation Assessment**:
- **Complexity**: Medium - Single technology stack but requires sophisticated PostgreSQL configuration and tuning
- **Timeline**: 8 months with faster implementation due to single technology focus
- **Cost**: Medium operational cost ($200K annually) with efficient resource utilization
- **Risk**: Low - PostgreSQL is mature, well-documented, and has extensive operational tooling

### Option 3: Cloud-Native Database Services Architecture
**Description**: Leverage cloud provider managed database services for different use cases. Amazon RDS/Aurora for transactional data, DynamoDB for high-throughput operations, ElasticSearch for search and analytics, S3 for object storage, and specialized services like Amazon Neptune for graph relationships.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Managed Operations**: Cloud provider handles database administration, scaling, backup, and security patching
- ‚úÖ **Elastic Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand without manual intervention or capacity planning
- ‚úÖ **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery with multi-region replication
- ‚úÖ **Security Integration**: Native integration with cloud security services and compliance frameworks
- ‚úÖ **Cost Optimization**: Pay-as-you-scale pricing models with automatic resource optimization

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **Vendor Lock-in**: Deep dependency on cloud provider services makes migration difficult and expensive
- ‚ùå **Data Sovereignty**: Challenges ensuring all child data remains within Indonesian jurisdiction
- ‚ùå **Cost Unpredictability**: Variable pricing based on usage can lead to unexpected cost spikes during high activity
- ‚ùå **Limited Customization**: Managed services may not support specific customizations required for child data protection
- ‚ùå **Compliance Complexity**: Cloud compliance frameworks may not align with Indonesian child protection regulations

**Child Safety Assessment**: **Fair** - Cloud security is robust but may not meet Indonesian data sovereignty requirements. Limited control over data location and access patterns could complicate compliance with local child protection laws.

**Implementation Assessment**:
- **Complexity**: Low technical complexity but high compliance complexity for Indonesian operations
- **Timeline**: 6 months for technical implementation but extended timeline for regulatory approval
- **Cost**: Variable cost ($150K-$600K annually) depending on usage patterns and data sovereignty requirements
- **Risk**: High regulatory risk due to data sovereignty requirements and limited control over data residency
