## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
MerajutASA Platform requires a comprehensive secrets management solution to securely store, rotate, and manage sensitive credentials including database passwords, API keys, encryption keys, and third-party service tokens. The current approach of storing secrets in environment variables and configuration files poses significant security risks, particularly for child data protection where any credential compromise could expose vulnerable children's personal information.

The platform needs enterprise-grade secrets management that provides centralized credential storage, automatic rotation, fine-grained access controls, comprehensive audit logging, and emergency access capabilities while maintaining high availability for child welfare operations.

### Child Welfare Considerations
Secrets management directly impacts child safety through multiple critical vectors:
