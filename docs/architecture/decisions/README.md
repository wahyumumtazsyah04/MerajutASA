# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
## Technical Decision Documentation for MerajutASA Platform

> **Mission**: Document architectural decisions with clear rationale, context, and consequences to enable informed decision-making and knowledge transfer while ensuring every technical choice serves our mission of protecting and supporting vulnerable children through the penta-helix collaboration model.

---

## 🎯 ADR Philosophy

### Child-Centered Architecture Decisions
All architectural decisions prioritize child safety, welfare, and platform mission:

```yaml
Decision Principles:
  Child Safety First: Every technical choice protects vulnerable children
  Mission Alignment: Decisions support orphanage operations and child welfare
  Stakeholder Value: Architecture serves penta-helix collaboration needs
  
Technical Values:
  Security by Design: Protection built into every architectural layer
  Accessibility First: Technology inclusive of all stakeholders and abilities
  Scalability for Impact: Architecture supports growing social impact
  Cultural Sensitivity: Technology respecting Indonesian values and context
```

### Evidence-Based Technical Decision Making
Systematic approach to architectural choices following industry best practices:
