## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack that provides real-time visibility into system health, performance metrics, and business impact while supporting the critical nature of child welfare operations. The monitoring system must detect and alert on issues before they impact vulnerable children's access to services, provide detailed insights into stakeholder collaboration effectiveness, and support proactive optimization of platform performance across the penta-helix model.

Current challenges include the need for multi-dimensional monitoring covering technical metrics (infrastructure, application performance, security events) and social impact metrics (stakeholder engagement, child safety indicators, emergency response times). The system must support diverse monitoring requirements from government compliance reporting to real-time emergency response coordination, while providing actionable insights for continuous improvement of child welfare services.

The distributed microservices architecture requires sophisticated monitoring capabilities including distributed tracing, service mesh observability, and correlation between technical events and business outcomes. Critical monitoring scenarios include detecting child safety system failures within seconds, tracking cross-stakeholder collaboration efficiency, monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements, and providing real-time visibility into emergency response coordination effectiveness.

### Child Welfare Considerations
The monitoring system directly impacts child safety through several critical dimensions:

- **Emergency Response Monitoring**: Real-time detection and alerting for system failures that could delay emergency child protection responses, with automatic escalation to ensure continuous service availability
- **Child Data Access Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trail monitoring for all access to sensitive child information, with anomaly detection to identify potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts
- **Service Availability Assurance**: Proactive monitoring to ensure 24/7 availability of critical child welfare services, preventing service disruptions that could impact vulnerable children's access to support
- **Compliance and Reporting**: Automated monitoring and reporting for regulatory compliance requirements, ensuring continuous adherence to child protection standards and audit readiness
- **Impact Measurement**: Real-time monitoring of child welfare outcomes and platform effectiveness, enabling data-driven improvements to services supporting vulnerable children

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

#### üèõÔ∏è Government Stakeholders
Government agencies require comprehensive compliance monitoring with automated reporting capabilities, real-time visibility into inter-agency collaboration effectiveness, and detailed audit trails for accountability. The monitoring system must provide dashboards for regulatory oversight, automated compliance violation detection, and comprehensive reporting capabilities supporting government transparency requirements and policy effectiveness measurement.

#### üè¢ Business Stakeholders
Corporate partners need real-time visibility into CSR program effectiveness, partnership collaboration metrics, and ROI measurement for social impact investments. The monitoring system must provide business intelligence dashboards, automated performance reporting, and comprehensive analytics supporting corporate decision-making and ESG reporting requirements.

#### üéì Academic Stakeholders
Research institutions require monitoring capabilities for research collaboration effectiveness, data access patterns analysis, and evidence-based program evaluation metrics. The monitoring system must support research analytics, institutional compliance monitoring, and comprehensive data quality assessment capabilities for academic research integrity.

#### üë• Community Stakeholders
Community organizations need visibility into volunteer engagement effectiveness, local program impact measurement, and community outreach success metrics. The monitoring system must provide accessible dashboards for community leaders, automated volunteer coordination monitoring, and comprehensive community impact assessment capabilities.

#### üì∞ Media Stakeholders
Media organizations require monitoring of content engagement effectiveness, story impact measurement, and awareness campaign success metrics. The monitoring system must provide media analytics dashboards, content performance monitoring, and comprehensive communication effectiveness measurement capabilities.

### Technical Context and Constraints
The monitoring system must integrate with our microservices architecture running on Amazon EKS, support monitoring for RabbitMQ messaging infrastructure, and provide comprehensive observability for Keycloak authentication systems. The system needs to handle high-volume metrics collection (millions of data points per hour), support distributed tracing across microservices, and integrate with our existing AWS infrastructure including CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, and AWS Security Hub.

Existing technical constraints include AWS infrastructure dependencies, Indonesian data sovereignty requirements for monitoring data, and integration needs with diverse stakeholder systems for external monitoring and reporting. The solution must support both real-time alerting and historical analysis, provide comprehensive security monitoring capabilities, and maintain high availability with minimal performance impact on production systems.

### Timeline and Dependencies
Implementation must be completed within 5 months to support the monitoring requirements for the production platform launch. This decision depends on the completion of the microservices architecture (ADR-001), messaging system implementation (ADR-007), and authentication system deployment (ADR-006). The monitoring system will serve as a foundational component for subsequent performance optimization and capacity planning initiatives.
