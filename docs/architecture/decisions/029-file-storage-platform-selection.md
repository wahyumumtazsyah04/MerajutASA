## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a comprehensive file storage solution to manage diverse digital assets including child profile documents, orphanage records, educational materials, donor receipts, legal compliance documents, media assets for awareness campaigns, and research data. The current lack of a centralized, secure file storage system creates data fragmentation, security vulnerabilities, compliance risks, and inefficient stakeholder collaboration. The platform needs a scalable, secure, and cost-effective storage solution that can handle varying file types while maintaining strict access controls and audit trails.

### Child Welfare Considerations
File storage directly impacts child safety through secure document management and data protection:
- **Secure Document Storage**: Child identity documents, medical records, and case files require maximum security with encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches that could endanger children
- **Educational Asset Management**: Learning materials, progress reports, and educational resources need organized storage with version control to support continuous child development and educational outcomes
- **Legal Document Protection**: Custody papers, legal guardianship documents, and court records require tamper-proof storage with full audit trails to protect children's legal rights and ensure compliance with family law requirements
- **Emergency Access Protocols**: Critical child information must be accessible to authorized personnel during emergencies while maintaining security protocols to ensure rapid response for child safety incidents

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

#### üèõÔ∏è Government Stakeholders
