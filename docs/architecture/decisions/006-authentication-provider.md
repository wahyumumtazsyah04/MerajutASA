## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a robust, scalable, and secure authentication and identity management system that can serve the diverse needs of the penta-helix collaboration model while maintaining the highest standards of child data protection. The system must handle multiple user types with varying access levels, from government officials requiring federated single sign-on to community volunteers using social authentication, all while ensuring strict controls around access to sensitive child information.

Current challenges include the need for unified identity management across multiple stakeholder portals (gov.merajutasa.id, business.merajutasa.id, community.merajutasa.id, etc.), integration with existing government identity systems, support for both technical and non-technical users, and compliance with international child protection standards. The solution must balance security rigor with accessibility, ensuring that essential child welfare services remain available even to users with varying technical capabilities.

### Child Welfare Considerations
Authentication decisions directly impact child safety through several critical dimensions:

- **Access Control for Child Data**: Strict identity verification prevents unauthorized access to sensitive child information, protecting vulnerable populations from potential exploitation or privacy breaches
- **Emergency Access Patterns**: Authentication system must support emergency scenarios where immediate access to child information is required for safety purposes, while maintaining audit trails
- **Age-Appropriate Access**: Different authentication flows for child users versus adult stakeholders, following COPPA and GDPR requirements for minor data protection
- **Safeguarding Compliance**: Integration with background check systems and mandatory reporting workflows to ensure only verified individuals can access child-related information
- **Privacy by Design**: Identity management that minimizes data collection, supports pseudonymization, and enables right-to-erasure compliance for child data protection

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

#### üèõÔ∏è Government Stakeholders
Government users require seamless integration with existing identity systems (SPBE Indonesia, e-Government SSO) for regulatory compliance and inter-agency collaboration. The authentication system must support role-based access for different government functions (social services, education ministry, local government) with comprehensive audit trails for accountability. Integration with PKI-based government certificates and support for multi-factor authentication aligned with government security standards is essential.

#### üè¢ Business Stakeholders
Corporate partners need enterprise-grade single sign-on capabilities that integrate with their existing identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace). The system must support API key management for automated integrations, role-based access for different corporate functions (CSR teams, financial departments, executive leadership), and comprehensive audit capabilities for ESG reporting requirements.

#### üéì Academic Stakeholders
Researchers and educational institutions require federated authentication support (ORCID, institutional SSO systems, eduGAIN federation) with granular permissions for research data access. The system must support temporary access grants for student researchers, ethics board oversight integration, and data access logging for institutional compliance requirements.

#### üë• Community Stakeholders
Community users need accessible authentication options including social login (Google, Facebook) while maintaining security standards. The system must support offline verification processes for volunteers without smartphone access, integration with local organization membership systems, and simple password recovery mechanisms for users with varying technical capabilities.

#### üì∞ Media Stakeholders
Media professionals require press credential verification, role-based access to approved content and statistics, and integration with media organization identity systems. The authentication system must support embargo controls, media asset access permissions, and comprehensive usage tracking for content licensing and attribution requirements.

### Technical Context and Constraints
The authentication system must integrate with our microservices architecture running on Amazon EKS, support the Kong API Gateway for request routing and rate limiting, and maintain compatibility with React web applications and React Native mobile applications. The system needs to handle peak loads during emergency situations (up to 10,000 concurrent users), support offline-first mobile authentication, and integrate with our PostgreSQL primary database while leveraging Redis for session management.

Existing technical constraints include AWS infrastructure dependencies, Indonesian data sovereignty requirements, and integration needs with existing orphanage management systems that may have limited technical capabilities. The solution must support both OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for modern integrations and potentially legacy authentication methods for older government systems.

### Timeline and Dependencies
Implementation must be completed within 8 months to support the Q3 2025 platform launch. This decision depends on the completion of the microservices architecture foundation (ADR-001) and database strategy implementation (ADR-002). The authentication system will serve as a foundational component for subsequent API gateway configuration (ADR-003) and frontend application development.
