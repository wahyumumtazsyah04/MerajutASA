## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform needs to support complex workflows across government agencies, business partners, academic institutions, community organizations, and media stakeholders while maintaining the highest standards of child data protection. The monolithic architecture approach would create bottlenecks in development velocity, deployment flexibility, and stakeholder-specific customization while potentially compromising the security isolation required for protecting vulnerable children's data.

As the platform scales to serve thousands of orphanages across Indonesia's 34 provinces, the architecture must support:
- Independent development teams for different stakeholder domains
- Varying regulatory requirements across geographic regions
- Different security and privacy requirements for different data types
- Elastic scaling based on regional usage patterns
- High availability requirements for emergency child protection services

### Child Welfare Considerations
This architectural decision directly impacts our ability to protect vulnerable children through:
- **Data Isolation**: Microservices enable strict data boundaries, ensuring child personal information is segregated from operational data and stakeholder-specific information
- **Emergency Response**: Independent services ensure that critical child safety functions remain operational even if other platform components experience issues
- **Compliance Granularity**: Different services can implement specific compliance requirements (GDPR for European partners, COPPA for international NGOs, Indonesian child protection laws) without affecting other platform areas
- **Audit Trail Precision**: Each microservice can maintain detailed audit logs specific to its function, enabling precise tracking of child data access and modifications
