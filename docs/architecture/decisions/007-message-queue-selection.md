## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a robust, scalable, and reliable asynchronous messaging system to handle critical communications between microservices, enable real-time notifications for child safety incidents, and support the complex workflows inherent in penta-helix stakeholder collaboration. The system must ensure message delivery for time-sensitive child welfare operations while maintaining high availability and performance across distributed services.

Current challenges include the need for guaranteed message delivery for critical child safety alerts, coordination between multiple stakeholder systems with varying response times, handling of bulk operations like mass notifications during emergencies, and integration with existing microservices architecture. The messaging system must support both real-time event processing and batch operations while maintaining strict audit trails for compliance with child protection regulations.

The platform's distributed nature requires asynchronous communication patterns to prevent cascading failures and ensure system resilience. Critical use cases include emergency notification delivery to multiple stakeholder groups, coordination of multi-step approval workflows for child welfare decisions, synchronization of data across microservices, and reliable processing of high-volume operations like volunteer matching and donation processing.

### Child Welfare Considerations
The messaging system directly impacts child safety through several critical dimensions:

- **Emergency Response Reliability**: Critical child safety alerts must be delivered with guaranteed delivery semantics, ensuring no emergency notification is lost during system outages or high-load scenarios
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: All messaging related to child welfare decisions must maintain complete audit trails for regulatory compliance and incident investigation
- **Cross-Agency Coordination**: Reliable message delivery enables seamless coordination between government agencies, orphanages, and support organizations during child protection incidents
- **Real-Time Safety Monitoring**: Low-latency message processing supports real-time monitoring systems that can detect and respond to potential child safety concerns
- **Data Protection in Transit**: All messages containing child-related information must be encrypted and protected according to international child protection standards

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

#### üèõÔ∏è Government Stakeholders
Government agencies require reliable integration with existing inter-agency communication systems, guaranteed delivery of regulatory compliance notifications, and seamless coordination between multiple government departments (social services, health, education). The messaging system must support integration with SPBE Indonesia systems, enable automated compliance reporting workflows, and provide comprehensive audit trails for government accountability requirements.

#### üè¢ Business Stakeholders
Corporate partners need reliable notification systems for CSR program updates, automated reporting of partnership activities, and integration with enterprise systems for real-time collaboration. The messaging system must support API-based integrations with corporate platforms, enable bulk processing of donation and sponsorship transactions, and provide reliable delivery confirmation for business-critical communications.

#### üéì Academic Stakeholders
Research institutions require reliable data synchronization for research datasets, automated notification systems for research collaboration opportunities, and integration with institutional systems for seamless data exchange. The messaging system must support secure data sharing workflows, enable automated compliance notifications for research ethics requirements, and provide reliable coordination for multi-institutional research projects.

#### üë• Community Stakeholders
Community organizations need reliable volunteer coordination messaging, automated notifications for volunteer opportunities, and integration with local organization systems. The messaging system must support offline-capable messaging for areas with limited connectivity, enable bulk messaging for community outreach campaigns, and provide reliable coordination between multiple community organizations.

#### üì∞ Media Stakeholders
Media organizations require timely notification of approved story opportunities, automated content distribution systems, and reliable coordination for media campaigns. The messaging system must support embargo controls for sensitive content, enable automated media asset distribution, and provide reliable notification systems for time-sensitive communication opportunities.

### Technical Context and Constraints
The messaging system must integrate seamlessly with our microservices architecture running on Amazon EKS, support the Kong API Gateway for external integrations, and maintain compatibility with our PostgreSQL primary database and Redis caching layer. The system needs to handle peak loads during emergency situations (up to 100,000 messages per minute), support multiple message patterns (pub/sub, point-to-point, request/reply), and integrate with our monitoring and alerting infrastructure.

Existing technical constraints include AWS infrastructure dependencies, Indonesian data sovereignty requirements for government communications, and integration needs with varying stakeholder systems ranging from modern APIs to legacy government platforms. The solution must support both synchronous and asynchronous patterns, provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, and maintain high availability across multiple availability zones.

### Timeline and Dependencies
Implementation must be completed within 6 months to support the messaging requirements for other platform components. This decision depends on the completion of the microservices architecture foundation (ADR-001), authentication system implementation (ADR-006), and database strategy deployment (ADR-002). The messaging system will serve as a foundational component for subsequent notification service implementation and real-time monitoring capabilities.
