## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform's microservices architecture (ADR-001) requires a sophisticated API gateway that can manage access across five distinct stakeholder groups while maintaining the highest standards of child data protection. The gateway must serve as the unified entry point for all external communications while providing:

- **Stakeholder-specific authentication and authorization** for government agencies, business partners, academic institutions, community organizations, and media stakeholders
- **Child data protection controls** including request filtering, response sanitization, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Rate limiting and DDoS protection** to ensure platform availability during emergencies and high-traffic scenarios
- **API versioning and backward compatibility** to support evolving stakeholder integration requirements
- **Real-time monitoring and analytics** for compliance reporting and performance optimization
- **Geographic routing and caching** optimized for Indonesia's archipelago geography

The solution must integrate seamlessly with the multi-database strategy (ADR-002) while providing consistent security controls across all microservices without compromising performance or stakeholder user experience.

### Child Welfare Considerations
This API gateway decision directly impacts our ability to protect vulnerable children through:
- **Request Validation**: Ensuring all API requests comply with child data protection standards before reaching internal services
- **Response Filtering**: Automatically removing or masking sensitive child information based on requestor authorization levels
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: Logging all child data access attempts with full request context for compliance and security monitoring
- **Emergency Access Controls**: Providing rapid access to critical child information during emergency situations while maintaining security protocols
- **Data Minimization Enforcement**: Ensuring API responses contain only the minimum necessary child information based on stakeholder role and specific use case

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

**Performance Needs**: Sub-second response times for emergency child protection queries, batch processing capabilities for compliance reports, and high availability during disaster response scenarios with automatic failover capabilities.

#### üè¢ Business Stakeholders  
**Integration Requirements**: RESTful APIs for corporate system integration, webhook support for real-time donation and partnership notifications, comprehensive analytics APIs for ESG reporting, and secure financial transaction processing with PCI compliance.

**Performance Needs**: High-throughput API access for large corporate donors, real-time transaction processing for donation campaigns, and global API access for multinational corporate partners with geographic load balancing.

#### üéì Academic Stakeholders
**Integration Requirements**: Research-focused APIs with built-in anonymization controls, institutional authentication integration (SAML, LDAP), long-term API stability for longitudinal studies, and bulk data export capabilities with appropriate privacy controls.

**Performance Needs**: Complex analytical query support, large dataset transfer capabilities, and integration with statistical computing platforms (R, Python) with academic workflow optimization.

#### üë• Community Stakeholders
**Integration Requirements**: Mobile-optimized APIs with offline synchronization support, simplified authentication for volunteer applications, geographic-based API routing for local community features, and social media integration APIs.

**Performance Needs**: Low-latency mobile API access, efficient data synchronization for offline-capable applications, and bandwidth-optimized responses for areas with limited internet connectivity.
