## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
MerajutASA Platform's microservices architecture requires sophisticated service-to-service communication management, including secure inter-service authentication, traffic routing, load balancing, circuit breaking, and observability. The current approach of direct service communication without a service mesh creates security vulnerabilities, lacks comprehensive traffic control, and provides limited visibility into service interactions, particularly concerning for child data flows between services.

The platform needs enterprise-grade service mesh capabilities that provide zero-trust networking, automatic mTLS encryption, advanced traffic management, comprehensive observability, and policy enforcement while ensuring child data protection throughout all service communications and supporting emergency response scenarios.

### Child Welfare Considerations
Service mesh implementation directly impacts child safety through multiple critical security and operational vectors:

- **Child Data Protection**: All inter-service communication containing child personal information, medical records, case files, and family details must be encrypted and authenticated to prevent data interception or unauthorized access during service-to-service communication
- **Service Isolation**: Critical child welfare services must be protected from cascading failures through circuit breaking, timeout controls, and traffic isolation ensuring emergency response systems remain operational
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete observability of service interactions enables comprehensive audit trails for child data access, ensuring compliance with Indonesian data protection laws and international child safety standards
- **Emergency Response**: During child safety emergencies, traffic routing and failover capabilities ensure critical services remain available while maintaining security controls and audit compliance

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis
