## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy to ensure continuous service availability and data protection in the event of system failures, natural disasters, security incidents, or regional infrastructure outages. The current system lacks formal disaster recovery procedures, automated backup processes, and failover mechanisms, creating significant risks for service continuity and data loss. Given the critical nature of child welfare services and the platform's role in supporting vulnerable children across Indonesia, any service interruption could have severe consequences for child safety, stakeholder operations, and platform credibility. The organization needs a robust, tested, and automated disaster recovery strategy that prioritizes child data protection, ensures rapid service restoration, and maintains stakeholder confidence during crisis situations.

### Child Welfare Considerations
Disaster recovery directly impacts child safety through service continuity and data protection during emergencies:
- **Emergency Service Continuity**: Child safety services must remain operational during disasters to support emergency response, crisis intervention, and ongoing care coordination for vulnerable children
- **Critical Data Protection**: Child identity records, medical information, case files, and legal documents require absolute protection against data loss with multiple redundant backup systems and rapid recovery capabilities
- **Emergency Communication Systems**: Platform communication capabilities must be maintained during disasters to enable coordination between emergency responders, child welfare agencies, and care providers for child safety incidents
- **Regulatory Compliance Continuity**: Disaster recovery procedures must ensure continued compliance with child protection laws and data retention requirements even during system failures or regional disasters

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

### Technical Context and Constraints
The platform currently operates on AWS infrastructure with single-region deployment, creating single points of failure and disaster vulnerability. Technical constraints include budget limitations for multi-region infrastructure, complexity of cross-region data synchronization, compliance requirements for data residency, and integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems. The solution must work within the current microservices architecture while providing automated failover capabilities, data consistency guarantees, and minimal recovery time objectives. Dependencies include completion of file storage implementation (ADR-029), monitoring system optimization (ADR-023), and security framework implementation (ADR-017) for comprehensive disaster recovery coverage.

### Timeline and Dependencies
Implementation is required within 6 months to address identified risk exposures and meet compliance requirements. Dependencies include completion of backup infrastructure setup, establishment of secondary region deployment, implementation of automated failover systems, and comprehensive disaster recovery testing procedures. The strategy must be operational before the Indonesian monsoon season and include provisions for various disaster scenarios including natural disasters, cyber attacks, and infrastructure failures affecting regional connectivity.
