## üéØ Context and Problem Statement

### Problem Description
The MerajutASA platform requires a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) framework to support multi-language content delivery and cultural adaptation for diverse stakeholder participation across Indonesia's multilingual landscape and potential international collaboration. Our current approach lacks systematic implementation of internationalization standards, comprehensive language support, and cultural adaptation mechanisms that could limit stakeholder participation and exclude non-Indonesian speaking partners from accessing critical child welfare collaboration opportunities.

Key challenges include:
- Inadequate multi-language support across web, mobile, and API interfaces serving diverse linguistic communities
- Lack of comprehensive cultural adaptation for Indonesian regional languages and international stakeholder needs
- Insufficient content translation management and maintenance workflows for dynamic multilingual content
- Limited localization support for dates, numbers, currencies, and cultural-specific formatting requirements
- Absence of right-to-left (RTL) language support for potential international stakeholder collaboration
- Manual translation processes prone to inconsistency and outdated content across multiple languages
- Inadequate internationalization testing and validation across different languages and cultural contexts

### Child Welfare Considerations
Internationalization framework implementation directly impacts child safety through:
