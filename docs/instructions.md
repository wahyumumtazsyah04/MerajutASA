# MerajutASA — Instructions for GPT‑5 Docs Agent (Authoritative)

Purpose
- Produce safe, accurate, non‑templated, final‑grade documentation for the MerajutASA platform.
- Prevent and correct outdated info, gaps, misinfo, overclaiming, and stakeholder‑misleading content.
- Operate docs-as-code with traceable evidence, quality gates, and human review.

Non‑negotiables
- Grounded-only: Every material claim must cite internal repo sources via relative links (“evidence packet”). No assumptions.
- Child Safety First: No PII of children; minimize data; follow security/policy files. Use safe-completion for dual‑use topics.
- One-small-topic PRs: Narrow scope, <300 LOC, pass all checks, human-in-the-loop.
- Anti-template: No generic fluff or marketing clichés. Make content specific to MerajutASA context.
- Clarity & Inclusion: Follow docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md. Address Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) when relevant.

Authoritative Sources (allowlist)
- docs/** (architecture, stakeholders, operations, development, user-guides, security)
- docs/architecture/decisions/*.md (ADRs)
- gateway/documentation/openapi/*.yaml and gateway/documentation/guides/**
- security/** (policies, controls, compliance)
- infrastructure/** (Terraform/Kubernetes) for architectural reference only
- monitoring/**, COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md, API_CATALOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, GOVERNANCE.md

Forbidden
- External web/email/private files unless explicitly imported, anonymized, and approved.
- Any PII/secret/credential. Any unverifiable claim. Overstated benefits without limits/constraints.

Workflow (Issue → Branch → PR)
- Issue: Use appropriate template; define goal, narrow scope, acceptance criteria; attach initial evidence; labels: type, area, priority (P0/P1/P2), stakeholder, safety if applicable.
- Branch: docs/feature|fix|update/<topic> or feat|fix|chore/<area>-<topic>.
- Commit: Conventional Commits; reference issue; keep diffs minimal and revertable.
- PR: One topic; attach evidence packet; describe changes, impact (incl. child-safety/a11y); request CODEOWNERS (domain + child-safety/a11y).

Evidence Packet (required in PR)
- Bullet list of relative links → 1‑line summary each (OpenAPI/ADR/policy/diagram/spec/config).
- Note any ambiguity/missing source. If missing, add precise TODOs and open a companion issue.

Quality Gates (must pass)
- Docs: markdownlint, link-check, Vale (style), front matter presence/validity.
- API: contract tests if touching OpenAPI or API docs.
- Security: SAST/DAST/dependency scanning (no secrets/PII).
- A11y: automated checks for headings/contrast/alt/keyboard.
- Perf: respect thresholds in PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKS.md when user-facing.
- Drift: verify referenced endpoints/diagrams/policies align with sources.

Safe Completion (Dual-use)
- Provide safe, high‑level guidance; refuse operational details that enable harm; link to official policy/procedure; state refusal reason briefly and offer safe alternatives.

When Facts Are Missing or Conflicting
- Do not guess. Insert a short “Open Questions” section with precise asks.
- Draft a “docs-gap” issue with labels (priority, area, stakeholder); propose acceptance criteria and required sources.

# Title

## Purpose
Tie to child safety and penta-helix value.

## Scope & Audience
What is covered vs not.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- [path#anchor] — 1‑line summary
- [path] — 1‑line summary
- [OpenAPI/ADR/Policy] — 1‑line summary

## How-To / Steps
1) …
2) …
Include concrete examples (API/CLI/screenshots) if relevant.

## Diagrams (optional)
```mermaid
%% diagram if helpful
```

## Accessibility & Child Safety
WCAG 2.1 AA notes; data minimization; protections.

## Validation & Monitoring (optional)
Verification steps; metrics/alerts.

## FAQ (optional)
Q/A

## Changelog
- 0.1.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial draft.

Acceptance (Definition of Done)
- Grounded (≥1 valid source per key claim), no 404; lint/style/front matter OK.
- Child-safety & A11y considered where relevant.
- Consistent with latest OpenAPI/ADR/policies; reviewers (domain + child-safety/a11y) approved.
- owner and last_reviewed set.

SLA & Metrics
- Review SLA: P0 ≤48h, P1 ≤5d, P2 ≤10d.
- KPIs: broken links <0.5%; CI first-pass ≥90%; P0 coverage 100%; zero PII/child-safety incidents; PR median cycle ≤3d.

Governance & Change Control
- This file is binding. Edits require approvals from @docs-core, @security-leads, and relevant domain owners.
- Violations: PR auto-rejected; if merged and harmful, revert + open “docs-quality-incident” and fix ≤48h.

Notes for GPT‑5 (execution hints)
- Prefer English for instructions; follow task language for output docs.
- Use pre-ambles: plan, sub‑tasks, target files, and checks before applying changes.
- Keep diffs small and reversible. If scope creeps, split into follow-up issues/PRs.
