# API Documentation
## Unified API Gateway for Penta-Helix Collaboration

Welcome to the MerajutASA API Documentation. This comprehensive API gateway implements Microsoft's API Management best practices and Amazon API Gateway design principles, serving as a unified entry point for all stakeholder interactions while enabling seamless integration that fosters the penta-helix collaboration model for child welfare.

## üåê API Gateway Philosophy

### Digital Public Infrastructure for Social Impact
Following MOSIP (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) principles, our API gateway creates standardized interfaces that enable broader ecosystem participation in supporting child welfare, facilitating transparent and secure collaboration between government, business, academia, community, and media stakeholders.

#### Core API Principles

##### 1. Stakeholder-Centric Design
- **Government Integration**: Estonia's X-Road principles for secure data exchange
- **Business Partnership**: Salesforce.org corporate philanthropy platform model
- **Academic Research**: MIT J-PAL evidence-based policy design approach
- **Community Engagement**: Stanford Social Innovation Review collective impact model
- **Media Collaboration**: Solutions Journalism Network approach

##### 2. Security and Privacy by Design
- **Child Protection First**: UNICEF digital protection standards implementation
- **Data Minimization**: GDPR principles with enhanced child data protection
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify security model
- **Audit and Transparency**: Complete API usage tracking and compliance reporting

##### 3. Scalable and Resilient Architecture
- **Microservices Gateway**: Service mesh integration with Istio
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes-native scaling based on demand
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Resilience during high-load or service failures
- **Global CDN**: Low-latency access for international stakeholders
