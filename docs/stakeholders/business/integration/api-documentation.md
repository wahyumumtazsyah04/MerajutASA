## üìã API Architecture and Access Framework

### Enterprise API Gateway and Security

#### API Gateway Architecture
```markdown
## Enterprise-Grade API Gateway for Child Welfare Integration

### API Gateway Infrastructure and Design
**Secure and Scalable API Access Point**:
Enterprise API gateway providing secure, monitored, and governed access to MerajutASA platform services for corporate partners and business stakeholders.

### Core Gateway Features and Capabilities
**Authentication and Authorization Framework**:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect implementation for enterprise SSO integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permission management
- API key management with automatic rotation and security monitoring
- Multi-factor authentication support for high-security business environments
- Enterprise directory integration (Active Directory, LDAP, Azure AD)

**Traffic Management and Performance Optimization**:
- Rate limiting and throttling to protect backend services and ensure fair usage
- Load balancing and automatic failover for high availability and reliability
- Request/response caching for improved performance and reduced latency
- API versioning support for backward compatibility and smooth upgrades
- Geographic routing for optimal performance across global corporate networks

### Security and Compliance Framework
**Data Protection and Privacy Controls**:
- End-to-end encryption for all API communications using TLS 1.3
- Request signing and verification for message integrity and authenticity
- IP whitelisting and geographic restrictions for enhanced security
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security monitoring
- Data loss prevention (DLP) integration for sensitive information protection

**Child Protection Compliance**:
- COPPA and GDPR compliance built into all API endpoints
- Automatic data anonymization for child-related information
- Consent management and privacy controls for all data access
- Incident response and breach notification automated workflows
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
```

#### API Authentication and Authorization
```yaml
Authentication Methods:
  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:
    Use Case: Interactive applications requiring user consent
    Security Level: High with user authentication and authorization
    Token Lifetime: 1 hour access token, 30-day refresh token
    
  Client Credentials Flow:
    Use Case: Server-to-server integrations without user context
    Security Level: Very high with mutual TLS authentication
    Token Lifetime: 1 hour with automatic refresh
    
  API Key Authentication:
    Use Case: Simple integrations and development environments
    Security Level: Medium with IP restrictions and rate limiting
    Token Lifetime: Configurable (recommended: 90 days with rotation)

# Configure API credentials
export MERAJUTASA_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export MERAJUTASA_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export MERAJUTASA_API_URL="https://api.merajutasa.id"
export MERAJUTASA_ENVIRONMENT="sandbox" # Use "production" for live data
```

```javascript
// Initialize API client
const MerajutASA = require('@merajutasa/business-api-sdk');

const client = new MerajutASA.BusinessClient({
  clientId: process.env.MERAJUTASA_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.MERAJUTASA_CLIENT_SECRET,
  environment: process.env.MERAJUTASA_ENVIRONMENT,
  scopes: ['csr.read', 'csr.write', 'analytics.read']
});

// Test API connectivity
async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const healthCheck = await client.health.check();
    console.log('API Connection Successful:', healthCheck);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API Connection Failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Authentication Implementation
**OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow Implementation**:
```javascript
// OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow
async function authenticateUser(redirectUri) {
  // Step 1: Generate authorization URL
  const authUrl = client.auth.getAuthorizationUrl({
    redirectUri: redirectUri,
    scopes: ['csr.read', 'csr.write', 'volunteers.read'],
    state: generateSecureState() // CSRF protection
  });
  
  // Step 2: Redirect user to authorization URL
  return authUrl;
}

// Handle authorization callback
async function handleAuthCallback(code, state) {
  try {
    // Verify state parameter for CSRF protection
    if (!verifyState(state)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid state parameter');
    }
    
    // Exchange authorization code for access token
    const tokens = await client.auth.exchangeCodeForTokens(code);
    
    // Store tokens securely (encrypted storage recommended)
    await storeTokensSecurely(tokens);
    
    return tokens;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
```

#### Phase 2: CSR Program Integration
```yaml
CSR Integration Implementation:

  Impact Measurement Integration:
    Data Collection: Automated metrics collection from platform activities
    Analysis: AI-powered impact analysis and trend identification
    Reporting: Automated report generation and stakeholder distribution
    Optimization: Continuous improvement recommendations based on data
```

#### Phase 3: Employee Engagement System Integration
```markdown
## Employee Volunteer System Integration

### Volunteer Opportunity Management
**Automated Opportunity Matching and Registration**:
```javascript
// Create volunteer opportunity
async function createVolunteerOpportunity(opportunityData) {
  try {
    const opportunity = await client.volunteers.createOpportunity({
      title: opportunityData.title,
      description: opportunityData.description,

        background_check: opportunityData.backgroundCheckRequired,
        training_required: opportunityData.trainingModules,
        minimum_age: 18,
        child_interaction: opportunityData.childInteraction
      }
    });
    
    return opportunity;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create volunteer opportunity:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Employee volunteer registration
async function registerEmployeeVolunteer(employeeId, opportunityId) {
  try {
    const registration = await client.volunteers.registerEmployee({
      employee_id: employeeId,
      opportunity_id: opportunityId,
      emergency_contact: employeeData.emergencyContact,
      skills_offered: employeeData.skills,
      availability: employeeData.availability,
      accessibility_needs: employeeData.accessibilityNeeds
    });
    
    // Trigger background check if required
    if (registration.background_check_required) {
      await client.volunteers.initiateBackgroundCheck(registration.id);
    }
    
    return registration;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Volunteer registration failed:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Impact Tracking and Employee Development
**Professional Development Through Volunteer Service**:
```javascript
// Track employee volunteer impact
async function trackEmployeeImpact(employeeId, timeRange) {
  try {
    const impact = await client.analytics.getEmployeeImpact({
      employee_id: employeeId,
      start_date: timeRange.start,
      end_date: timeRange.end,
      include_professional_development: true
    });
