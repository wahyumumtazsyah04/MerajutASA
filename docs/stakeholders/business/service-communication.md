# Business Service Communication Guidelines

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive service communication guidelines for business partnership integration with MerajutASA Platform, ensuring secure API access, child data protection, and reliable corporate system connectivity. This framework enables business partners to integrate their systems safely while maintaining strict security standards and operational excellence.

## Scope and Audience
This framework applies to business technical teams and system integrators responsible for:
- Corporate API development and integration
- Business system connectivity and data exchange
- CSR platform integration and automation
- Corporate analytics and reporting system integration
- Third-party vendor system integration for business partners

**Exclusions**: This framework does not cover user interface integrations, which are addressed in [business security requirements](security-requirements.md).

## Key Facts with Internal References

### Service Communication Architecture
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Business services connect through [Istio service mesh](../../architecture/decisions/026-service-mesh-selection.md) with business-specific traffic policies
- **API Gateway Security**: Corporate API access uses [secure API gateway](../../architecture/security/authentication-architecture.md#api-gateway) with OAuth 2.0 and rate limiting
- **Encrypted Communication**: All business service communications use [automatic mTLS encryption](../../architecture/security/service-mesh-policies.md#business-mtls) and secure protocols
- **Service Discovery**: Business services utilize [secure service discovery](../../architecture/security/network-security.md#service-discovery) with authentication and authorization

### Business Integration Patterns
- **CSR Analytics API**: Corporate partners access [CSR impact analytics](../../architecture/api/analytics-api.md#business-analytics) through secure, rate-limited API endpoints
- **Partnership Management API**: Business partners manage [partnership activities](../../architecture/api/partnership-api.md) through dedicated service endpoints
- **Notification Integration**: Corporate systems receive [partnership notifications](../../architecture/decisions/028-notification-service-platform-selection.md#business-notifications) through secure webhook endpoints
- **Financial Integration**: Corporate donation systems integrate through [secure payment APIs](../../architecture/security/data-protection.md#payment-integration) with PCI DSS compliance

## Implementation Steps for Business Technical Teams

### Phase 1: API Integration Setup and Authentication (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Corporate API Credentials and Authentication**
   - Obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials for corporate system integration
   - Configure secure authentication flow with corporate identity providers
   - Set up API key management and rotation procedures
   - **Expected Outcome**: Functional API authentication for corporate system integration

2. **Service Mesh Integration Configuration**
   - Deploy corporate services with service mesh sidecar injection
   - Configure service mesh policies for business service communication
   - Set up mTLS encryption for corporate service-to-service communication
   - **Expected Outcome**: Secure service mesh integration for corporate services

3. **API Gateway and Rate Limiting Setup**
   - Configure API gateway endpoints for corporate system access
   - Implement rate limiting and throttling for business API usage
   - Set up API monitoring and analytics for corporate integration
   - **Expected Outcome**: Configured API gateway with proper security controls

### Phase 2: Business Service Development and Testing (Weeks 3-4)
1. **CSR Analytics API Integration**
   - Develop corporate analytics service integration with platform APIs
   - Implement data validation and error handling for corporate analytics
   - Configure automated CSR impact report generation and delivery
   - **Expected Outcome**: Functional corporate analytics integration

2. **Partnership Management API Development**
   - Integrate corporate partnership management systems with platform APIs
   - Configure automated partnership activity tracking and reporting
   - Implement corporate workflow automation for partnership processes
   - **Expected Outcome**: Automated corporate partnership management integration

3. **Notification and Communication Integration**
   - Set up webhook endpoints for corporate notification delivery
   - Configure corporate communication system integration with platform
   - Implement automated corporate stakeholder communication workflows
   - **Expected Outcome**: Integrated corporate communication and notification systems

### Phase 3: Security Validation and Operational Deployment (Week 5)
1. **Security Testing and Validation**
   - Conduct security testing of corporate API integrations
   - Validate service mesh security policies and encryption
   - Test corporate service authentication and authorization
   - **Expected Outcome**: Validated security for corporate service integrations

2. **Performance Optimization and Monitoring**
   - Optimize corporate service performance and response times
   - Configure comprehensive monitoring for corporate service health
   - Set up automated alerting for corporate integration issues
   - **Expected Outcome**: Optimized and monitored corporate service integrations

## Child Safety and Accessibility Considerations

### Child Data Protection in Service Communications
- **API-Level Data Protection**: Corporate service APIs never expose individual child data, providing only aggregated analytics and statistics
- **Secure Service Boundaries**: Service mesh policies ensure corporate services cannot access child welfare operational data
- **Purpose-Limited Access**: Corporate service communication restricted to CSR impact measurement and partnership management only
- **Automatic Data Classification**: All data flowing through corporate service APIs automatically classified and filtered for child data protection

### Service Reliability and Child Welfare
- **High Availability Design**: Corporate service integrations designed for 99.9% availability to support continuous child welfare operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Corporate service failures do not impact child welfare service operations through proper isolation
- **Emergency Service Priority**: Child welfare services maintain priority access during corporate service integration issues
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Automatic circuit breakers protect child welfare services from corporate service overload

### Accessibility and Business Integration
- **API Documentation Standards**: Corporate API documentation follows accessibility standards with clear examples and comprehensive guides
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Corporate service APIs support integration across diverse business technology platforms
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Clear error messages and recovery procedures help corporate teams quickly resolve integration issues
- **Developer Experience**: Corporate integration tools designed for ease of use by business development teams
