## ðŸ“Š Impact Measurement Philosophy and Framework

### Evidence-Based Impact Assessment
All measurement approaches prioritize rigorous evidence and authentic impact demonstration:

```yaml
Measurement Principles:
  Child Welfare Priority: All metrics focus on genuine improvements in child welfare outcomes
  Evidence-Based Rigor: Measurement tools based on validated assessment methodologies
  
Assessment Values:
  Transparency: Open, honest reporting of both successes and challenges
  Accountability: Clear accountability for partnership commitments and outcomes
```
