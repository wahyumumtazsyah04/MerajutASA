# Business Partnership Security Requirements

## Purpose
Define comprehensive security requirements for business partnership engagement with MerajutASA Platform, ensuring child data protection, corporate compliance standards, and secure CSR integration. This framework enables corporate partners to safely contribute to child welfare initiatives while maintaining the highest standards of privacy, security, and ethical business practices.

## Scope and Audience
This framework applies to all business stakeholders engaging with MerajutASA Platform including:
- Corporate CSR teams and social impact managers
- Business development and partnership teams
- Corporate security and compliance officers
- Third-party vendors and contractors working with business partners
- Corporate foundation and philanthropy teams

**Exclusions**: This framework does not cover employee volunteerism, which is addressed through [community stakeholder guidelines](../community/volunteer-communication.md).

## Key Facts with Internal References

### Corporate Security Architecture Integration
- **Enterprise Security Standards**: Business partnerships must meet [enterprise-grade security requirements](../../architecture/security/data-protection.md#enterprise-security) including SOC 2 Type II compliance
- **API Security Framework**: Corporate integrations use [secure API authentication](../../architecture/security/authentication-architecture.md#business-api) with OAuth 2.0 and certificate-based authentication
- **Data Protection Compliance**: Business partners follow [strict data protection protocols](../../architecture/security/data-protection.md#business-protection) ensuring child data never leaves the platform perimeter
- **Network Security Controls**: Corporate access utilizes [enterprise network security](../../architecture/security/network-security.md#business-access) with VPN connections and firewall restrictions

### Business Data Access and Limitations
- **CSR Impact Analytics Only**: Business partners receive [aggregated CSR impact metrics](../../architecture/security/data-classification.md#business-analytics) with no access to individual child data
- **Partnership Performance Data**: Corporate partners access [partnership-specific performance analytics](../../architecture/security/access-control.md#business-roles) limited to their own contributions and impact
- **Financial Transaction Security**: Corporate donations and funding utilize [secure payment processing](../../architecture/security/data-protection.md#financial-security) with PCI DSS compliance
- **Brand Asset Protection**: Corporate brand assets and communications use [secure content management](../../architecture/security/communication-security.md#stakeholder-communication-permissions) with approval workflows
