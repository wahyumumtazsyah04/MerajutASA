## Purpose
Ensure consistent, accessible, and safe use of brand assets. Follow docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md for text and formatting.

## Logo usage (clearspace, min size, do/don't)
- Approved logo files: docs/stakeholders/media/media-assets/logos/
- Do not alter colors or proportions. Do not overlay on busy imagery. Avoid placement near sensitive content.

## Color palette & contrast (a11y)
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA contrast for text on brand colors: docs/architecture/compliance/accessibility-compliance.md

## Typography & imagery
- Typography must be readable and follow docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md.
- Imagery must not depict identifiable children; follow privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Prefer using approved, redacted visuals from: docs/stakeholders/media/media-assets/ (logos/, screenshots/, infographics/, videos/)


## Naming & attribution
- Use "MerajutASA" consistently. Attribute assets per Media Guidelines: docs/stakeholders/media/media-guidelines.md

## Co-branding rules
