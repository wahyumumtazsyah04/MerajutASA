## Purpose
Provide a structure for anonymized, consented case studies that comply with privacy-by-design.

## Structure template
- Context, challenge, intervention, outcomes, lessons learned. Do not include PII of children.

## Anonymization & consent
- Follow privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Align with data classification and local child protection requirements (to be added to security/...).

## Asset checklist
- Images/graphics follow a11y and privacy standards.

## Review & approval workflow
- Coordinate via Expert Contacts and Media Guidelines.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Accessibility and privacy requirements apply to all artifacts: docs/architecture/compliance/accessibility-compliance.md; docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md

## Open Questions
- security policy files and local regulation mappings referenced in the brief are not present. Add exact links once available.
- CITATION.cff not present; add once available.

## Changelog
