## Purpose
Provide a structure for anonymized, consented case studies that comply with privacy-by-design.

## Structure template
- Context, challenge, intervention, outcomes, lessons learned. Do not include PII of children.

## Anonymization & consent
- Follow privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Align with data classification: security/policies/data-classification.md
- Observe privacy obligations: docs/stakeholders/community/policies/privacy-policy.md

## Asset checklist
- Images/graphics follow a11y and privacy standards.

## Review & approval workflow
- Coordinate via Expert Contacts and Media Guidelines.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Accessibility and privacy requirements apply to all artifacts: docs/architecture/compliance/accessibility-compliance.md; docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Cite MerajutASA when using materials: CITATION.cff

## Open Questions
- The specific local regulation files are not present and outside the current allowlist path:
  - security/compliance/requirements/local-regulations/indonesia-data-protection.md
  - security/compliance/requirements/local-regulations/indonesia-child-protection.md
  Proposal: add these under an approved path or extend the allowlist in a follow-up PR. Until then, reference docs/architecture/compliance/regulatory-mapping.md.

## Changelog
- 2025-08-08: Initial draft.
