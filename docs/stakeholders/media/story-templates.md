## Purpose
Provide narrative frameworks that comply with our style guide, glossary definitions, child-safety, and privacy-by-design.

## Narrative frameworks (human-interest, data-driven, partnerships)
- Human-interest without PII; focus on systems and outcomes; see privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Data-driven pieces should cite metrics defined in impact-metrics: docs/stakeholders/media/impact-metrics.md
- Partnerships: align roles with stakeholder governance: docs/stakeholders/governance-model.md

## Required disclaimers & redaction
- Redact any identifying child info; obtain documented consent for any adult testimonials.

## Quotes & attribution policy
- Follow style guidance for quotes and attributions: docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Use agreed terminology from: docs/GLOSSARY.md

## Pre-publication checklist
- Validate compliance with docs/stakeholders/community/policies/terms-of-service.md, docs/stakeholders/community/policies/privacy-policy.md, and docs/stakeholders/community/policies/content-policy.md
- Complete accessibility review per docs/architecture/compliance/accessibility-compliance.md (verify alt text, captions, contrast ratios)
- Cross-reference all numerical claims against docs/stakeholders/media/impact-metrics.md data sources
- Apply digital safety protocols from security/training/child-safety/digital-safety.md before publication
 
## Key Facts (Grounded)
- Privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
