## Purpose
Provide narrative frameworks that comply with our style guide, glossary definitions, child-safety, and privacy-by-design.

## Narrative frameworks (human-interest, data-driven, partnerships)
- Human-interest without PII; focus on systems and outcomes; see privacy-by-design: docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md
- Data-driven pieces should cite metrics defined in impact-metrics: docs/stakeholders/media/impact-metrics.md
- Partnerships: align roles with stakeholder governance: docs/stakeholders/governance-model.md

## Required disclaimers & redaction
- Redact any identifying child info; obtain documented consent for any adult testimonials.

## Quotes & attribution policy
- Follow style guidance for quotes and attributions: docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md

## Pre-publication checklist
- Terms, privacy, and content rules upheld: docs/community/policies (to be added);
- Check accessibility (alt text, captions): docs/architecture/compliance/accessibility-compliance.md
- Verify metrics with impact-metrics: docs/stakeholders/media/impact-metrics.md

## Key Facts (Grounded)

- Style and terminology: docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md
