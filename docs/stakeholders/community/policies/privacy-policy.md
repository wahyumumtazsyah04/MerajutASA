# Privacy Policy

## Purpose
Protect the privacy of children and all stakeholders in documentation and media assets by enforcing privacy-by-design.

## Scope & Audience
- Applies to all docs and assets under `docs/**` in this repository.
- Excludes application runtime privacy policies.

## Key Facts (Grounded)
- [docs/architecture/compliance/privacy-by-design.md] — Architectural privacy principles and controls.
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] — Community behavior and child safety expectations.
- [SECURITY.md] — Vulnerability disclosure procedures.

## How-To / Steps
1) Do not include children’s PII or identifiable imagery.
2) Minimize data in examples; prefer anonymized/synthetic data.
3) Remove metadata from images/videos before committing.
4) Cite internal sources for all factual claims.

## Accessibility & Child Safety
- Privacy is a child-safety mechanism; follow WCAG 2.1 AA for any media.

## Validation & Monitoring
- CI link-check and linting; reviewers ensure compliance.

## Changelog
- 1.0.0 (2025-08-08): First complete policy for repository docs/assets.
