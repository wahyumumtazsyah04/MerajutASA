# Storytelling Guide

## Principles
- Dignity first: never sensationalize or exploit.
- Privacy by default: anonymize identities unless explicit guardian consent is documented.
- Safety over virality: remove any data that could identify a child or location patterns.

## Consent
- Obtain verifiable guardian consent for any identifiable media.
- Log consent artifacts in the secure consent registry.

## Review Workflow
- Draft → Safety review → Legal review (if needed) → Publish.
- Use the editorial checklist aligned with docs/architecture/security/communication-security.md#content-security-monitoring.
