# Community Safety Guidelines

- Background checks and mandatory training before any child-facing activity.
- Use only platform communication tools; no private contact with children.
- Respect privacy; never share child PII. See data-privacy.md and SECURITY.md.
- Report concerns immediately via reporting-system.md.
