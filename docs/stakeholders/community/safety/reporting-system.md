# Community Reporting System

Use this system to report concerns. If a child is in immediate danger, contact local emergency services first, then notify us.

## Emergency Contacts
- See SECURITY.md#emergency-contacts for canonical addresses and response targets.

## What to Report
- Child safety risks, inappropriate contact, policy violations, misuse of platform features.

## How to Report
- Online Form: authenticated form within the portal (audited).
- Email: child-safety-emergency@merajutasa.id for emergencies; security-incident@merajutasa.id for platform security.
- Anonymous Option: available via the portal; provide as much detail as possible without including child PII.

## After You Report
- You receive an acknowledgement.
- Safety team triages per SECURITY.md timelines.
- We may contact you for clarification; do not share reports publicly.

## Safeguards
- Reports are logged in a tamper-evident system.
- Retaliation is prohibited; violations result in removal and potential escalation.
