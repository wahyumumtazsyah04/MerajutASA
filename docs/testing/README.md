- **Emergency Response Testing**: Critical system response during child welfare emergencies

##### 2. Accessibility and Inclusion Testing
- **W3C WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines implementation
- **Assistive Technology Compatibility**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, voice control
- **Cognitive Load Testing**: Age-appropriate interfaces for different developmental stages
- **Multi-Language and Cultural Testing**: Indonesian, regional languages, and cultural contexts

##### 3. Stakeholder-Centric Quality Assurance
