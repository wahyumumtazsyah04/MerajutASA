    - Dynamic imports for optional features
    - Platform-specific code separation
    - Tree shaking for unused code removal
    
  Asset Optimization:
    - Image compression and format optimization
    - Font subsetting for multi-language support
    - Icon optimization and vector usage
    - Audio and video compression

Performance Monitoring:
  Real-Time Monitoring:
    - Firebase Performance Monitoring
    - Custom performance metrics tracking
    - Crash reporting with Bugsnag
    - ANR (Application Not Responding) tracking
    
  Optimization Feedback:
    - Performance regression alerts
    - Automated performance testing
    - Device-specific optimization recommendations
    - User experience impact analysis

Release Management:
  Phased Rollouts:
    - Staged release to minimize risk
    - A/B testing for new features
    - Feature flags for controlled releases
    - Rollback capabilities for critical issues
    
  Update Strategy:
    - Forced updates for security fixes
    - Optional updates for feature enhancements
    - Background updates for non-critical fixes
    - User education about new features
