# Infrastructure Documentation
## Cloud-Native Infrastructure for Social Impact at Scale

Welcome to the MerajutASA Infrastructure Documentation. This comprehensive guide implements Infrastructure as Code principles following HashiCorp's infrastructure lifecycle model, enabling consistent, reproducible environments from development to production while optimizing for social impact and cost-efficiency.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Philosophy

### Cloud-Native Social Impact Architecture
Implementing AWS Well-Architected Framework principles specifically adapted for social impact organizations, ensuring platform reliability and cost-efficiency that maximizes donation impact through optimized resource utilization.

#### Core Infrastructure Principles

##### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Declarative Configuration**: All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Reproducible Environments**: Identical infrastructure across development, staging, and production
- **Progressive Delivery**: Staged rollouts following DORA's progressive delivery patterns
- **Cost Optimization**: Automated resource scaling based on social impact metrics

##### 2. Security and Privacy by Design
- **OWASP ASVS Level 2**: Application Security Verification Standard for sensitive data
- **UNICEF Child Protection**: Digital protection standards for vulnerable populations
- **EU DPIA Methodology**: Data Protection Impact Assessment for children's data
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify security model

##### 3. Observability and Social Impact Alignment
- **SRE Principles**: Google's Site Reliability Engineering adapted for social services
- **Metrics That Matter**: Stanford Social Innovation Review framework implementation
- **Real-time Impact Tracking**: Technical performance directly mapped to mission outcomes
- **Stakeholder-Centric Monitoring**: Different views for different penta-helix stakeholders
